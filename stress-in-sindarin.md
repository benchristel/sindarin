# Concerning Stress Placement In Sindarin

In Appendix E of _The Lord of the Rings_, Tolkien gives the following account of stress in Eldarin languages:

> In words of two syllables [the stress] falls in practically all cases on the first syllable. In longer words it falls on the last syllable but one, where that contains a long vowel, a diphthong, or a vowel followed by two (or more) consonants. Where the last syllable but one contains (as often) a short vowel followed by only one (or no) consonant, the stress falls on the syllable before it, the third from the end.

Succinct! An elegant system, to be sure. But Tolkien himself seems to have contradicted this description in a few places, and therefore I think the subject of stress in Sindarin merits closer study than the Appendices will support.

The contradictory examples I have in mind are the place-names _Imladris_, that is Rivendell, and _Nargothrond_, the stronghold of Finrod. If the Appendices are taken at their word, these should be _imlAdris_, _nargOthrond_, since the next-to-last syllable has two following consonants. However, these names are found in verses whose meter makes it clear that they are to be stressed on the *initial* syllable:

> Seek for the Sword that was broken:
> In Imladris it dwells[...] (_The Fellowship of the Ring_, p. 259)

> The world was fair, the mountains tall,
> In Elder Days before the fall
> Of mighty kings in Nargothrond[...] (_The Fellowship of the Ring_, p. 330)

A recording of Tolkien reading a fragment of the latter poem confirms the stress placement beyond doubt; that recording can be found [here](http://www.jrrvf.com/~glaemscrafu/english/tolkienhimselflotrhob.html) (click on "Nargothrond" in the list). The evidence for _Imladris_ is less certain; it could conceivably be stressed on the second syllable, though that would force the first two syllables of the line into an awkward trochee with "in" both stressed and long. The metrical evidence may be strengthened by the observation that Tolkien could have substituted "Rivendell" for _Imladris_ without marring the meaning of the poem, if he found the stress of the Sindarin word unsuited.

If we accept that _Imladris_ and _Nargothrond_ are counterexamples to the stress rules laid out by Tolkien in Appendix E, that leaves us with the question of _why_ their stress is exceptional. Actually, I think these words are probably not exceptional at all; rather, the Appendices give a simplified account of Eldarin stress patterns that is valid in most, but not all, cases. The following re-analysis of Sindarin stress rules closely parallels David Salo's (as found in his _Gateway to Sindarin_), though I disagree with his description of syllable division.

A syllable is _heavy_ if it contains a long vowel or dipthong, or ends in one or more consonants. If the second-to-last syllable in a polysyllabic word is heavy, it is stressed. If not, the third-to-last syllable receives the stress.

If only a single consonant separates two vowels, the syllable boundary is before the consonant. Where syllables are separated by two consonants, the syllable boundary _usually_ falls between the consonants, making the first syllable heavy. E.g. _Gon.dor_, _E.dhel.harn_. However, if the two consonants could form a valid initial cluster, as _dr_, _thr_, they both go with the second syllable: _im.la.dris_, _nar.go.thrond_, _ce.le.brim.bor_.

If this theory of Sindarin stress placement holds up, it has implications for several other words, many of them names of peoples ending in -rim: e.g. _Halethrim_. Other affected words include _Hadhodrond_, _Celebrond_.
