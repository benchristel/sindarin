# Concerning Stress Placement In Sindarin

In Appendix E of _The Lord of the Rings_, Tolkien gives the following description of stress in Eldarin languages:

> In words of two syllables [the stress] falls in practically all cases on the first syllable. In longer words it falls on the last syllable but one, where that contains a long vowel, a diphthong, or a vowel followed by two (or more) consonants. Where the last syllable but one contains (as often) a short vowel followed by only one (or no) consonant, the stress falls on the syllable before it, the third from the end.

An elegant system, to be sure! But Tolkien himself seems to have contradicted this description in a few places, and therefore I think the subject of stress in elvish languages merits closer study than the Appendices will support.

The contradictory examples I have in mind are the Sindarin place-names _Imladris_, that is Rivendell, and _Nargothrond_, the stronghold of Finrod. If the Appendices are taken at their word, these should be stressed _imlAdris_, _nargOthrond_, since the next-to-last syllable has two following consonants. However, these names are found in verses whose meter makes it clear that they are stressed on the *initial* syllable:

Boromir's poem at the Council of Elrond:

```
Seek for the Sword that was broken:
In Imladris it dwells[...] (_The Fellowship of the Ring_, p. 259)
```

Gimli's song in Moria:

```
The world was fair, the mountains tall,
In Elder Days before the fall
Of mighty kings in Nargothrond
And Gondolin, who now beyond
The Western Seas have passed away:
The world was fair in Durin's Day. (_The Fellowship of the Ring_, p. 330)
```

A recording of Tolkien reading a fragment of the latter poem confirms the stress placement beyond doubt; that recording can be found [here](http://www.jrrvf.com/~glaemscrafu/english/tolkienhimselflotrhob.html) (click on "Nargothrond" in the list). The evidence for _Imladris_ is less certain; it could conceivably be stressed on the second syllable, though that would force the first two syllables of the line into an awkward trochee with "in" both stressed and long. The metrical evidence may be strengthened by the observation that Tolkien could have substituted _Rivendell_ for _Imladris_ without marring the meaning of the poem, if he found the stress of the Sindarin word unsuited.

If we accept that _Imladris_ and _Nargothrond_ are counterexamples to the stress rules laid out by Tolkien in Appendix E, that leaves us with the question of _why_ their stress is exceptional. Several explanations are possible.

## 1. _Nargothrond_ is Exceptional

_Nargothrond_ may be a dialectical or archaic form of Sindarin. Ordinarily, -nd in a polysyllabic word would reduce to -n: the expected Sindarin form is _Nargothron_. The name _Gondolin_ from the same poem is also not an expected Sindarin form—that would be _Gonglin_. Tolkien may have chosen these forms to emphasize the age of the poem, or perhaps the age of the things it describes. If _Nargothrond_ is not classical Sindarin, it would not necessarily be subject to the stress rules from Appendix E.

_Imladris_ must have a different explanation. It could conceivably be stressed on the second syllable in Boromir's poem, though in my opinion stress on the first syllable seems a more natural fit for the meter. The pronunciation might also show Gondorian influence, as Gondor had its own distinct dialect of Sindarin. However, this seems less likely in light of the poem apparently being divine inspiration, and not a product of Boromir's own mind. He did not know the name Imladris before he heard the poem in his dream.

## 2. Sindarin Meter Is Based on Quantity, Not Stress

The discussion of the "exceptional" stress in _Nargothrond_ and _Imladris_ is founded on the assumption that Sindarin considers stress relevant to the meter of a poem. It is possible that stress is actually not relevant, and Sindarin poetry is based on syllable length or _quantity_ instead. There is some indirect evidence that this is how Sindarin poetry works. In (TODO cite chapter) Aragorn mentions a mode of verse called _ann-thennath_, presumably meaning "long-shorts" and describing a pattern of alternating long and short syllables. If _Imladris_ and _Nargothrond_ are syllabified as _Im.la.dris_ and _Nar.go.thrond_, the first and last syllables of each would be long (due to the consonant coda), and we would therefore expect those syllables to fall on stresses in the meter of the poem, which in fact they do.

This theory is wounded by the fact that _Imladris_ and _Nargothrond_ are found in poems written in *English*. English verse often conflates stress and length by making stressed syllables long, but it is stress that is most important to the meter. Additionally, the metrical patterns of our only example of Sindarin verse, the hymn to Elbereth, seem to be stress-based and not quantity-based, so perhaps quantity is not relevant at all for Sindarin poetry.

## 3. Tolkien Changed His Mind

The recording of Gimli's poem was made before the publication of _The Lord of the Rings_, but Tolkien continued work on the Appendices until _The Return of the King_ was published (fact-check this, but it seems production of the Appendices delayed the publication of RotK). He had ample time to revise the stress rules in that period, and when he finally settled on the rules published in Appendix E, he may have forgotten that verses published in _The Fellowship of the Ring_ contradicted those rules.

If this theory were correct, it would place students of Sindarin in an unfortunate position. "Lord of the Rings-era Sindarin", usually thought of as a coherent version of the language, would be inconsistent on this point.

## 4. Inspiration from Latin

This last theory is the one I personally prefer. It is highly speculative, of course, but so are all the others. It rests on the observation that the stress rules in Appendix E seem to be borrowed from Latin. If we jump to conclusions and surmise that subtler points of the Latin stress rules would also be valid in Eldarin, we can explain the stress pattern of _Imladris_ and _Nargothrond_ with a general rule rather than an exception.

In Latin, syllables could be either long or short; a syllable was long if it ended in a long vowel, diphthong, or consonant. When a consonant cluster occurred in the middle of a word, it was usually divided between its adjacent syllables, causing the preceding syllable to end in a consonant and thus be long.

The third-to-last syllable of a polysyllabic word was stressed in Latin, unless the second-to-last syllable was long, in which case that syllable received the stress. The Latin stress rule could therefore be summarized: "Stress the second-to-last syllable if it contains a long vowel or diphthong or is followed by two or more consonants, and the third-to-last syllable otherwise." This is the same rule that Tolkien gives for Eldarin languages in Appendix E.

However, Latin has an additional complication in some words: Clusters of the form **stop**+**liquid** could occur at the beginning of a syllable, and therefore did not necessarily make the preceding syllable long. A word like _volucris_ "bird" could be syllabified and stressed as either _vó.lu.cris_ or _vo.lúc.ris_.

If the same holds true in Eldarin languages, then a word like _Imladris_ could be syllabified as either _im.lád.ris_ or _ím.la.dris_, since the cluster _dr_ can begin a syllable in Sindarin (cf. the many words that begin in _dr_). The same rule would apply to _Nargothrond_, which could be pronounced _nar.góth.rond_ or _nár.go.thrond_.

If we accept the premise that Eldarin stress rules are identical to those of Latin, it is still unclear why the rules were not fully detailed in Appendix E. The omission could be explained thus: rather than overwhelm his readers with minutiae, Tolkien may have opted for the simplest description that would lead to correct pronunciation of prose, and trusted that readers would overlook the printed stress rules when reading poetry.

TODO: summary of stress in Latin
~~This system of syllabification has some precedent. It is in fact close to the [system used by Latin](http://www.hhhh.org/perseant/libellus/aides/allgre/allgre.11.html), which Tolkien learned in his youth and whose stress rules are remarkably similar to those of Eldarin languages as described in Appendix E.~~ Latin, however, has an additional complication: clusters in -l or -r cleave to the following syllable, and lengthen the preceding syllable only at the writer's discretion (relevant in poetry, where syllable length determines the meter). A Latin word like _volucris_ "bird" would normally be syllabified and stressed _vó.lu.cris_, though in poetry it could be _vo.lúc.ris_.

A syllable is _heavy_ if it contains a long vowel or diphthong, or ends in one or more consonants. If the second-to-last syllable in a polysyllabic word is heavy, it is stressed. If not, the third-to-last syllable receives the stress.

If only a single consonant separates two vowels, the syllable boundary is before the consonant. Where syllables are separated by a consonant cluster, the syllable boundary _usually_ falls between the consonants, making the first syllable heavy. E.g. _Gon.dor_, _E.dhel.harn_. However, if a medial two-consonant cluster can occur at the beginning of a syllable, as _dr_, _thr_, the entire cluster is part of the syllable following it: _im.la.dris_, _nar.go.thrond_, _ce.le.brim.bor_.

Of course, the mere similarity to Latin proves nothing. Tolkien's knowledge of Latin would not constrain him to apply exactly the stress rules of Latin to his own languages. *Had he chosen to do so*, however, all the data would be neatly explained. Words of the form (C)VC(C)VCrV(C)(C) (_Imladris_, _Nargothrond_) could be stressed either on the third-to-last or second-to-last syllable. It would therefore be unsurprising to see them stressed on the first syllable in poetry. The omission of this rule from Appendix E can be explained thus: rather than overwhelm his readers with minutiae, Tolkien may have opted for the simplest description of Eldarin stress that would lead to correct pronunciation of prose, and trusted that readers would overlook the printed stress rules when reading poetry.

If this theory of Sindarin stress placement holds up, it has implications for several other compound names of the form **disyllable**+**monosyllable beginning in L or R**, including _Caradhras_, _Celebrant_, _Celebrond_, _Eledhrim_, _Falathrim_, _Galadhrim_, _Hadhodrond_, _Halethrim_, _Orodruin_. All of these could optionally be stressed on the first syllable.

It is not clear whether nasalized stops _mb_, _nd_, _ng_ can begin a syllable, and so it is unclear how the stress behaves when these clusters follow the penultimate vowel. To be sure, nasalized stops _nd_, _mb_, _ng_ can occur at the beginning of a _word_ in Sindarin, but only in mutated forms, and only following a vowel, so this does not necessarily mean they can be syllable-initial. For example, the phrase _i ndor_ "the land" could be syllabified as _i.ndor_ or _in.dor_. If the latter, then we would expect e.g. _Mithrandir_ to be stressed on the penultimate syllable; if the former, _Mithrandir_ should be stressed on the first syllable.
