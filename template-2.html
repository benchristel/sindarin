            <p>The element <b>*AWA</b>, appearing in 3(c) above, referred to movement away, viewed from the point of view of the thing, person, or place left. As a prefix it had probably already developed in CE the form <b>*au-</b>. The form <b>*awā</b> was originally an independent adverbial form, but appears to have been also used as a prefix (as an intensive form of *awa-, *au-). The form *wā- was probably originally used as a verbal stem, and possibly also in composition with verbal stems.</p>
            <p>In the Eldarin languages this stem made contact in form with other elements, distinct in origin and in sense.*ABA 'refuse', 'say nay (in refusal or denial)': this is the source of the CE *abar, pl. *abarī 'a refuser,' one who declined to follow Oromë. *WO in forms *wō and *wo- (the latter only as a prefix): this was a dual adverb 'together', referring to the junction of two things, or groups, in a pair or whole. The plural equivalent was *jō, *jōm, and as a prefix *jo, *jom. *HO in forms *hō and *ho: this was an adverb 'from, coming from', the point of view being outside the thing referred to.</p>
