# Sindarin Pronunciation

## Vowels

Sindarin vowels are comparable to those of Spanish. A, E, I, O, and U are pronounced "ah", "eh", "ee", "oh", and "oo". More specifically (assuming a General American accent)[^vowels]:

* A as in "father"
* E as in "pen"
* I as in "machine"
* O as in "old"
* U as in "brute"

[^vowels]: Tolkien's own pronunciation guide, in Appendix E, gives "father", "were", "machine", "for", and "brute" as the exemplars. "Were" and "for" are problematic for American speakers as the R-sound colors the vowel of "for" and completely replaces the vowel of "were". I have replaced these with "pen" and "old", though these words too present problems. Speakers with the pen/pin merger may find the former confusing, and the latter probably does not sufficiently illustrate the openness of Sindarin _o_.

Sindarin also has a sixth vowel, Y, whose sound has no equivalent in English. It is the sound of _u_ in French _lune_, or German _ü_ as in _über_. Unlike the English letter Y, Sindarin Y is always a vowel, never a consonant as in "yes".

In Sindarin, the vowels can be marked with an acute accent (á é í ó ú) indicating that they are held for a slightly longer duration. So in a word like _míriel_ "sparkling like jewels" (TODO cite translation), the first syllable _mí_ is held for two "beats", the second syllable _ri_ for one beat, and the third syllable _el_ for one beat (though it may actually take longer to say because of the final L).

A circumflex (â ê î ô û) also indicates a long vowel, but is mostly used in words of one syllable. This may just be an aesthetic whim of Tolkien's, though he justified it by saying that vowels with the circumflex should be held for _even longer_—three beats instead of two. However, the Elvish writing systems only distinguish two vowel lengths, long and short, so the Elves must not have considered this detail very important.

### Typing Accented Characters

On a Mac, you can type vowels with an acute accent by pressing `option`+`E` and then typing the vowel that you want. To type a circumflex, use `option`+`I` instead.

Typing special characters on Windows is considerably more annoying. The best way is probably to change your keyboard settings to international mode, which will let you type accented letters using key combinations. A guide to doing that can be found [here](http://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/accents/codeint.html). Alternatively, you can copy and paste the accented letters from the table below.

## Consonants

Many Sindarin consonants are pronounced as in English, and so need no further explanation. These include B, D, H, M, N, P, T, V, and W. The others require some special attention.

- C is always hard, as in "cat". _Celeborn_ is pronounced _Keleborn_, not _Seleborn_.
- F is usually pronounced as in English, but at the end of a word it sounds like V (think English "of"). The word _nef_ "on this side of" is pronounced _nev_ as in English "never". The Elvish writing systems don't reflect this complication—the V sound is there always spelled the same, regardless of where it appears in the word. This quirk of spelling probably hearkens back to Tolkien's fondness for Welsh, where _f_ has a V-sound.
- G is always hard, as in "get". The Elvish languages do not have the J-sound heard in "gem".
- L is always pronounced as in "let", with the tip of the tongue touching or just behind the upper teeth. In English, L is sometimes pronounced with the tongue bunched up in the back of the mouth, as in "cold", but this variant of L does not exist in Sindarin.
- R is trilled, as in Spanish. In Appendix E, Tolkien notes that the back-of-the-throat R-sound heard in French or German was not used by the Elves.
- S never sounds like Z, as it often does in English at the end of a word. It is always pronounced as in "sets".

### Digraphs

_Digraphs_ are pairs of letters that represent a single, indivisible sound—for example the _th_ in "thin" or the _sh_ in "ship". Sindarin has several digraphs.

#### Digraphs for Voiceless Sounds

Several of the digraphs represent _voiceless_ versions of more familiar sounds—_voice_ being a linguistics term meaning vibration of the vocal cords. Don't be worried by the terminology, though. If you can speak English, you're already pronouncing voiced and voiceless sounds all the time. You can feel the buzzing of your vocal cords if you put your hand on your throat and say "ZZZ". If you then turn the Z into an S, the buzzing stops. Voiced sounds like Z or V have a buzzing or humming quality, while their voiceless counterparts S and F sound more like a hiss or whisper.

The following three digraphs are voiceless versions of Sindarin consonants discussed above.

- HW is the _wh_ sound of "whale", in varieties of English that pronounce it differently from "wail".
- LH is the sound of _LL_ in Welsh _Llewellyn_—a peculiar sound, if you've not heard it before. To pronounce it, put your tongue in a position to say L, and blow gently. The resulting sound should be somewhere between _th_ and _sl_ (in fact, the LH sound developed from earlier SL, found in Old Sindarin).
- RH is a Sindarin R-sound pronounced voicelessly. If you can pronounce R and HW, you're halfway to pronouncing RH. Just pronounce R while exhaling breathily as for HW.

#### TH and DH

Following on the theme of voiced and unvoiced sounds, we have a pair of digraphs that differ only in voicing: voiceless _TH_ and voiced _DH_.

- TH is the sound of _th_ in _thin_.
- DH is the sound of _th_ in _this_.

If you're having trouble keeping the DH/TH distinction straight, remember that DH is like Z pronounced with an exaggerated lisp.

#### Miscellaneous

- CH is the sound in Scottish _loch_ or German _Bach_. If you have a hard time replicating this sound, you could pronounce it as H or K instead. That's what the Gondorians did when they spoke Sindarin. For instance, they pronounced the place-name _Rochan_ as if the _ch_ were an _h_—hence the spelling _Rohan_ in _LotR_.
- PH is pronounced as in _photograph_. In the middle of a word, it represents a lengthened F-sound: a word like _ephel_ "outer fence" would be pronounced _ef-fel_.
- NG at the beginning or end of a word is the sound heard in "ringer". In the middle of a word it represents the same sound plus a hard G, as in "finger".

### When Is a Digraph Not a Digraph?

The combinations DH, LH, RH, TH sometimes represent a sequence of two distinct sounds, e.g. T+H. For example, _Panthael_ (A name given to Sam Gamgee by Aragorn in the King's Letter), is a compound _pant_ "full" + _sael_ "wise" (_sael_ being mutated to _hael_ in this case), so the _t_ and _h_ represent distinct sounds. Similarly, _Edhelharn_ "Elfstone", one of Aragorn's epithets, is compounded from _edhel_ "elf" + _sarn_ "stone" (mutated to _harn_). So how do you know when to pronounce the letter-sequence "th" as T+H, and when to pronounce it as a single sound? The answer, unfortunately, is that you just have to recognize the (rare) cases where "th" represents T+H.

### A Note on NG and W

Sindarin allows the sounds NG and W in places where English doesn't. NG can occur at the beginning of a word, and W can occur at the end of a word.

## Stress

Sindarin, like English, puts emphasis or _stress_ on one syllable of multi-syllable words. Unlike English, Sindarin stress is predicatable from the shape of the word, so you don't have to memorize where the stress falls for each word individually.

### Hang on, What's a Syllable?

Breaking up a word into syllables doesn't come naturally to everyone, though it's not hard once you get the hang of it. Each syllable always contains exactly one vowel or diphthong, so to find the syllables in a Sindarin word, you just have to look for vowels, and break up the word so each chunk has one vowel or diphthong in it. A word like _caun_ "prince" has one syllable since _au_ is a diphthong. _Elbereth_ has three syllables: _El.be.reth_.

### Stress in Two-Syllable Words

"In words of two syllables, [the stress] falls in practically all cases on the first syllable." (_LotR_ Appendix E) Tolkien neglects to list the exceptions to this rule, so for our purposes, two-syllable Sindarin words are *always* stressed on the first syllable.

### Stress in Longer Words

The general rule for words of more than two syllables is to stress the third-to-last syllable. This is the case for _EL.be.reth_ and _gil.THO.ni.el_.

However, many words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable. This happens if the second-to-last syllable is followed by two or more consonants, or contains a long vowel or diphthong. Note that digraphs are considered a single consonant since they are pronounced as a single sound.
