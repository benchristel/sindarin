# Pronouncing Elvish

Before you start to put Sindarin words together into sentences, it's a good idea to learn how the words themselves are supposed to be pronounced. One of Tolkien's goals in designing his languages was to create words that he personally found beautiful, and he wrote a great deal about his love for the sounds of certain languages (notably Welsh and Finnish). With this in mind, it should be clear that correct pronunciation of Tolkien's languages is essential to appreciate them fully.

No pronunciation guide can be perfect, but recordings of Tolkien reading excerpts from _The Lord of the Rings_ provide the best possible guide to many of the words and names from his legendarium. Samples from those recordings can be found [on Gl«Ωmscrafu](http://www.jrrvf.com/~glaemscrafu/english/tolkienhimself.html).

The following is a quick synopsis of Sindarin pronunciation. It's designed to get your pronunciation to a level where, if you were teleported to Middle-earth, a Sindarin-speaker could understand you, even if he found your accent strange. If you're aiming for perfect pronunciation and want all the nitty-gritty details, you should read [the complete description](/sindarin/pronunciation-complete.html) and skip this page, since everything here is repeated there, but in more detail. And finally, if you have a background in linguistics or just know IPA for whatever reason, you should read the page [for linguists](./pronunciation-for-linguists.html).

## Vowels

The vowels are similar to those of Spanish, Hawaiian, or Italian: A, E, I, O, and U are pronounced "ah", "eh", "ee", "oh", and "oo". Y is always a vowel, and can be pronounced "ee"[^gondorian-y].

There are also several vowel combinations whose pronunciation you should know:

- AI and AE sound like "eye".
- AU is like the "ow" in "now".
- EI is the sound in "weigh".
- UI is an "oo" sound followed quickly by an "ee" sound, almost as in "ruin".

## Consonants

- C is always a hard K-sound, as in "cat".
- G is likewise always hard, as in "get".
- R should be trilled, as in Spanish.
- CH is the sound heard in Scottish _loch_ or German _Bach_. Gondorians often turned it into a K or H sound, and so can you.
- DH has the sound of _th_ in "leather".

All the other consonants should be pronounced pretty much as in English.

## But Wait, There's More!

This guide doesn't cover many of the details of Sindarin pronunciation. You should check out [the complete description](./pronunciation-complete.html) if you want to know more. Alternatively, you could read about [Elvish writing systems](../writing.html)

[^gondorian-y]: You'll have a Gondorian accent, but Elves should still be able to understand you.
