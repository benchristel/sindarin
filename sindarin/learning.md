# On Learning Tolkien's Languages

If you've read this far, you probably don't need me to justify *why* you should learn one of Tolkien's languages. On the other hand, I may owe you some explanation of *what* exactly it means to do so. Learning Elvish is not like learning to speak French or Spanish or any other living language, so if you've studied a foreign language before, you might be surprised at what you'll find (and won't find) within these pages.

A typical language course will start off with common phrases, like "please", "thank you", and "goodbye"—indispensable words, if you're going to travel in a foreign country. Yet Sindarin has no equivalent for any of these[^phrases]. The language course will also list the pronouns: _I_, _you_, _he_, _she_, etc. But Sindarin pronouns are a point of great contention: would you believe that people are still trying to figure out what the Sindarin word for _he_ is? In spite of these and many other difficulties, various people have tried to write language courses in Sindarin. While their efforts are impressive in their own right, I think that to approach Sindarin as if it were a living language of Earth is misguided. Sindarin is fundamentally unlike earthly languages in its purpose and execution, and deserves a different approach if we are truly to understand it.

Alert readers should smell a paradox here: Tolkien is renowned as a master linguist, a passionate philologist, and a pioneer of the art of language creation. He worked on Sindarin (or at least, on successive languages of a similar style to Sindarin) for essentially his entire adult life. How could he just *forget* to write down the Sindarin equivalents of "please" and "thank you"? I will devote the rest of this essay to resolving the paradox, but the summary is this: the lack of such conversational niceties among Tolkien's linguistic papers shows that he wasn't particularly interested in that aspect of language. His goal was not to make another Esperanto[^Esperanto], but to commune with his own linguistic muse to create something of great beauty. Measured against that goal his languages are a triumph. Against any other, they will inevitably fall short. Our proper course is not to patch up their supposed "faults", nor to dismiss them as unworthy, but to understand why they are the way they are. They are not that way by accident!

Tolkien's views on the matter of language creation are probably most fully revealed in the essay "A Secret Vice"—the "vice" in question being his peculiar hobby, called "secret" because "it can earn no prizes, win no competitions [. . .] make no birthday presents for aunts". He approaches the topic from an interesting angle: to dispel any preconceptions his audience might have about what the "secret vice" is, he first describes what it *isn't*. First on the "not it" list is _Animalic_, a language-game invented by his childhood acquaintances, which substituted animal names for ordinary English words. _Dog nightingale woodpecker forty_ meant "you are an ass".

Tolkien posits a hierarchy of constructed languages, with language-games like Animalic[^animalic] at the bottom, and aesthetically-motivated creations at the top. In the middle was _Nevbosh_ or "New Nonsense", invented by a friend of Tolkien's and to which Tolkien contributed some words. It was primarily made up of distorted English, French, and Latin words, strung together with English syntax. Tolkien gives a limerick as a sample:

> _Dar fys ma vel gom co palt, &lsquo;hoc_
> _Pys go iskili far maino woc?_
>     _Pro si go fys do roc de_
>     _Do cat im maino bocte_
> _De volt fac soc ma taimful gyróc!&rsquo;_
> <cite>_The Monsters and the Critics_ (=_MC_) p. 203</cite>

(A full translation is not given, but it must be: _There was an old man who said, "how / can I possibly carry my cow? / For if I were to ask it / To get in my basket / It would make such a terrible row!"_)

Interestingly enough, at least one word from Nevbosh appears to have made it into Elvish: _lint_ "quick, clever, nimble" (_MC_ p. 205). When Galadriel sang of _yéni ve **lintë** yuldar_ ("years like <b>swift</b> draughts") little did she suspect that her speech was Nevbosh-influenced! However, words like _lint_—that is, words chosen for the harmony between their sound and meaning—were firmly in the minority in the Nevbosh lexicon. And that, in Tolkien's mind, was what prevented Nevbosh from ascending to the heights of artistry that his later languages would aspire to.



[^animalic]: The game, played by some of Tolkien's childhood acquaintances, consisted of replacing words in ordinary speech with animal names. _Dog nightingale woodpecker forty_ meant "You are an ass".

So I've got some good news, and some bad news. The bad news is that you can't learn to speak Sindarin. The good news is that *Tolkien couldn't either*, but despite that fact (and maybe because of it) he found beauty in his languages and kept working on them, which means there's hope for us who want to study them. We can relish Sindarin the same way Tolkien did, and even revel in its incompleteness, for in the end we are (if I guess my audience correctly) all drawn by the same beacons that first attracted him: the harmony of sound and meaning; the nostalgia for a world that never was; the ache of unknowable loss. It was a feat of nigh-Fëanorian prowess that Tolkien achieved when he caught these great lights with his words and made them imperishable.

[^phrases]: Post-Tolkien coinages include _le hannon_ for "thank you" (invented by David Salo for the Peter Jackson movies) and _navaer_ for "goodbye" (a calque of Quenya _namárië_), but these of course don't count as authentic Tolkien-Sindarin.
[^Esperanto]: Esperanto is an "International Auxiliary Language" designed to aid communication between people of different native tongues. Tolkien had some fondness for Esperanto, owing to its status as "the creation ultimately of one man, not a philologist" ("A Secret Vice", _The Monsters and the Critics_ p.198) but apparently he didn't feel the need to imitate it!

The fact is that Tolkien simply didn't design his languages to be used for daily conversation. He himself wrote very little continuous text in them, and so the vast majority of our knowledge about Sindarin comes from the names of people and places. Given the state of our source material, it's not surprising that we can't write a course in the language without a lot of guesswork, editorial decisions, and new coinages. In fact, it's kind of amazing that we can describe Sindarin grammar at all!

The gaps in our knowledge of Sindarin are not the only problem, though, for even when we have evidence for a particular word or grammar rule it is often contradicted elsewhere. It's tempting to imagine that Tolkien just never had time to "finish" Sindarin, and that by clever deduction we could fill in the blanks and have a complete language. The truth seems to be that Tolkien simply had no interest in "finishing" his languages and putting them on the shelf, and was in fact constantly reworking them. This process of change and exploration was essential for him, and he continued to revise the languages throughout his entire life.

Take, for instance, the example of _The Etymologies_. This wordlist, which Tolkien worked on a few years before beginning _The Lord of the Rings_, details the evolution of Sindarin and Quenya words from their ancient forms. The _Etymologies_ weren't published until after Tolkien's death, but they now serve as one of our main sources of Elvish vocabulary.

Christopher Tolkien begins the introduction to _The Etymologies_, one of our main sources for Sindarin vocabulary, with this sentence:

> The mode of my father's linguistic construction, which as is well known was carried on throughout his life and in very close relation to the evolution of the narratives, shows the same unceasing movement as do they: a quality fundamental to the art, in which (as I believe) *finality and a system fixed at every point were not his underlying aim.* [Emphasis added]
> <cite><em>The Lost Road</em> (= _LR_), p. 377</cite>

Many parts of the _Etymologies_ manuscript are a "maze of forms and cancellations [. . .] so dense, and for the most part made so quickly, that one cannot be sure what [JRRT's] final intention was: in these parts he was working out potential connections and derivations on the spot, by no means setting down already determined histories" (_LR_ p. 380). The end of Tolkien's work on the _Etymologies_ perhaps signals that the document had become too unwieldy to maintain, not that he was satisfied with the derivations he'd worked out. In the later essay _Quendi and Eldar_, he describes derivations and ancient forms different from any that appear in the _Etymologies_; at the time he was working on _The Lord of the Rings_, he was still far from "finished" with his languages.

Even the finality of publication could not quell Tolkien's tendency to revise, revisit, and generally just change stuff. Take, for example, the phrase _mae govannen_ "Well met!" (_The Fellowship of the Ring_, p. 222). We know from _Parma Eldalamberon #17_ that Tolkien considered no fewer than three alternative explanations for this phrase: a verb _covad-_ "meet", with mutation of _c_ to _g_ yielding _govannen_; a verb _govan-_, with no mutation; and a verb _govan-_ with the initial _g_ disappearing under the effect of a second-person pronoun _ci_, itself mutated and abbreviated to _g'_, yielding _g'ovannen_. The problem (for us students) is that even after _LotR_ was published and the phrase _mae govannen_ set in stone, Tolkien was free to change his mind about the underlying words and grammatical rules that produced it—and we know from his surviving papers that he changed his mind constantly. And that means that *none* of the possible interpretations of _mae govannen_ can be picked out as the "right" one.[^govannen]

Lest the situation for students of Elvish seem hopeless, I should point out that there are many Sindarin constructions that remained essentially unchanged throughout Tolkien's entire life. In addition, many of Tolkien's revisions changed only the histories of the words, not the ultimate Quenya or Sindarin forms, so we can still confidently list a great many Sindarin words, even when their origins within the fictional history are not certain. However, I still want to draw attention to Tolkien's process of revision because I think it illustrates several important facts about the nature of his work:

1. He was as much interested in the historical development of words as in their ultimate forms.
2. He was more interested in exploring the possible histories than in declaring one version "official" and moving on.
3. As a result, his goal was never to make a language that anyone, including himself, could learn to speak fluently. He appreciated the languages in two ways: as the harmonious union of sound and meaning, and as weather-worn records of deep histories.

These facts all point towards a single conclusion: that Tolkien's languages are a fundamentally different kind of thing from the natural languages of our own earth, or even other artificial languages like Esperanto (designed to ease communication between people who have no other language in common). Human languages in general serve two purposes: to communicate ideas, and to act as a mark of identity for social groups. Nothing else—not logic, nor historical continuity, nor least of all euphony—can get in the way of these vital requirements. To be sure, Tolkien's Elves use language for the same day-to-day needs that we do[^purposes]—though Tolkien merely implies this rather than writing out Elvish dialogue. But really, Tolkien was not designing the languages to please the Elves (who, being fictional, could have no say in his decisions) but to please himself. For him, beauty of form, sound, structure, and history were paramount, and the requirements of quotidian communication could never usurp their place.

This brings me to the matter of why the present work is titled "A Ranger's Guide". If Tolkien's languages are fundamentally different in purpose from real languages, we need to approach our study of them in a different way. We can't hope to learn about Tolkien's vision of Elvish from studying dialogues, for example, because Tolkien himself never wrote any dialogues in Elvish and probably didn't much care if it was even possible to do so. My goal then with the "Ranger's Guide" is to map the territory (tree-tangled and bewildering as it is) of the Sindarin writings that Tolkien *did* leave behind. I will not try to cut a path, but I hope to teach you to live among the trees.

[^purposes]: Of course they used the languages for communication, and the languages must have been a significant part of the cultural identity of the various Elven tribes—otherwise Elwë's ban on Quenya would have been meaningless.
[^govannen]: Disclaimer: this discussion is based on material published in _Parma Eldalamberon #17_, which I do not actually own, it having gone out of print before I began studying Elvish seriously. I have had to base this paragraph on secondary sources, mainly Paul Strack's fabulous [Eldamo](http://eldamo.org/) site.)
