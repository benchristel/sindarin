# Quick Guide to Sindarin Pronunciation

This guide is designed to get your pronunciation to a level where Sindarin-speakers will understand you, even if they find your accent strange. If you're aiming for perfect pronunciation, you should read [the complete description](./pronunciation-complete.html).

## Vowels

The vowels are similar to those of Spanish, Hawaiian, or Italian: [.s A], [.s E], [.s I], [.s O], and [.s U] are pronounced "ah", "eh", "ee", "oh", and "oo". [.s Y] is always a vowel, and can be pronounced "ee"[^gondorian-y].

Examples:

    <td><span class="s">U</span></td>

An accent over a vowel, like [.s á] or [.s â], indicates that it is held for slightly longer.

Certain sequences of two vowels have their own pronunciation:

- [.s AI] and [.s AE] sound like "eye".
- [.s AU] ~ like "ow" in "now". [.s Aur] "day" sounds like English "hour".
- [.s EI] ~ as in "weigh".
- [.s OE] ~ like "oy" in "boy".
- [.s UI] ~ an "oo" sound followed quickly by an "ee" sound, almost as in "ruin": [.s Fanuilos] (a title of Elbereth).

## Consonants

- [.s C] is always a hard K-sound, as in "cat".
- [.s G] is likewise always hard, as in "get".
- [.s R] should be trilled, as in Spanish.
- [.s CH] is the sound heard in Scottish _loch_ or German _Bach_. Gondorians often turned it into a K or H sound, and so can you, if you prefer.
- [.s DH] has the sound of _th_ in "leather": [.s edhel] "elf".

The other consonants should be pronounced more or less as in English.

[^gondorian-y]: You'll have a Gondorian accent, but Elves should still be able to understand you. Most Sindarin speakers pronounced Y like German _ü_ in _über_.
