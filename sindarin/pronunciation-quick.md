# Quick Guide to Sindarin Pronunciation

This summary of Sindarin sounds is designed to get your pronunciation to a level where, if you were teleported to Middle-earth, a Sindarin-speaker could understand you, even if he found your accent strange. If you're aiming for perfect pronunciation and want all the nitty-gritty details, you should read [the complete description](./pronunciation-complete.html) and skip this page, since everything here is repeated there, but in more detail. And finally, if you have a background in linguistics or just know IPA for whatever reason, you should read the page [for linguists](./pronunciation-for-linguists.html).

## Vowels

The vowels are similar to those of Spanish, Hawaiian, or Italian: A, E, I, O, and U are pronounced "ah", "eh", "ee", "oh", and "oo". Y is always a vowel, and can be pronounced "ee"[^gondorian-y].

- _callon_ "hero" sounds roughly like English "call on".
- _pen_ "without" sounds like English "pen".
- _hîr_ "lord, master" sounds roughly like English "here". The accent indicates that the "ee" sound is held longer than an unaccented vowel.
- _tol_ "island" sounds roughly like English "toll".
- _dû_ "night" sounds like English "do".

There are also several vowel combinations whose pronunciation you should know:

- AI and AE sound like "eye".
- AU is like the "ow" in "now".
- EI is the sound in "weigh".
- UI is an "oo" sound followed quickly by an "ee" sound, almost as in "ruin".

## Consonants

- C is always a hard K-sound, as in "cat".
- G is likewise always hard, as in "get".
- R should be trilled, as in Spanish.
- CH is the sound heard in Scottish _loch_ or German _Bach_. Gondorians often turned it into a K or H sound, and so can you, if you prefer.
- DH has the sound of _th_ in "leather".

All the other consonants should be pronounced pretty much as in English.

## But Wait, There's More!

This guide doesn't cover many of the details of Sindarin pronunciation. You should check out [the complete description](./pronunciation-complete.html) if you want to know more. Alternatively, you could read about [Elvish writing systems](../writing.html)

[^gondorian-y]: You'll have a Gondorian accent, but Elves should still be able to understand you. Most Sindarin speakers pronounced Y like German _ü_ in _über_.
