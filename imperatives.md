The [.term imperative] form of a verb is the form used for
directly telling someone to do something. In English, it's
the simplest verb form, with no endings added: _[.hi eat],
[.hi drink], and [.hi be] merry!_

In Sindarin, imperative verbs are used for commands and
wishes. Many examples can be found in _The Lord of the Rings_:

!!bullets

- Glorfindel's cry to his horse Asfaloth: [.s Noro lim, noro lim Asfaloth!] No translation is given, but [.s noro lim] probably means "Run fast!"
- Haldir's command to the Fellowship in Lórien: [.s Daro!] "Halt!"
- Sam's invocation of Elbereth, which ends [.s A tiro nín, Fanuilos!] "O look towards me, Everwhite!"
- The cry [.s Eglerio!] "Glorify [them]!", celebrating Frodo and Sam after Sauron is defeated.

It's not hard to create the imperative form of a verb from its dictionary form: just add [.s o] to the end. If the dictionary form of the verb ends in an [.s a], drop the [.s a] before adding [.s o].

- [.s linna-] "sing" &rarr; [.s linno]
- [.s car-] "do" or "make" &rarr; [.s caro]
- [.s beria-] "protect" &rarr; [.s berio]
- [.s cen-] "see" &rarr; [.s ceno]

## The dictionary verb-form

Sindarin wordlists almost always list verbs by a special
"dictionary form", which ends in a dash. The dictionary form
can't be used as-is; you have to add endings to use the
verb in a sentence.

## Direct Objects

Some verbs don't make a whole lot of sense without a target
or [.term direct object] for the action. For example, you
probably wouldn't say [.s berio!] "protect!" in Sindarin
without specifying *what* to protect. You'd generally say
something like [.s berio i pherian!] "protect the hobbits!", in
which case "the hobbits" would be the direct object.

The direct object can also be a [.term pronoun], like "her",
"him", or "me". The grammar for using pronouns
as direct objects is simpler than the grammar for using
nouns, so this lesson only covers pronouns.

The table below lists the pronouns you can use
as direct objects. As in English, they come after the
verb:

!!example

[.s Dago hon!] "Kill him!"

[.s Aphado hain!] "Follow them!"

[.s Tiro nin!] "Watch me!"

[.s Berio ven!] "Protect us!"

/!

<table class="columns">
<tr class="head">
  <td></td>
  <td>Singular</td>
  <td>Plural</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1<sup>st</sup> person</td>
  <td>[.s nin] &ldquo;me&rdquo;</td>
  <td>[.s ven] &ldquo;us&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2<sup>nd</sup> person</td>
  <td>[.s le] &ldquo;yourself&rdquo;</td>
  <td>[.s.salo le] &ldquo;yourselves&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2<sup>nd</sup> p. familiar</td>
  <td>[.s gin] &ldquo;yourself&rdquo;</td>
  <td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3<sup>rd</sup> person</td>
  <td>[.s han] &ldquo;him/her/it&rdquo;,<br/>[.s.salo hon] &ldquo;him&rdquo;, [.s.salo hen] &ldquo;her&rdquo;</td>
  <td>[.s hain] &ldquo;them&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
</table>

The second person [.s le] can be used whether you
are addressing one person or many. However, as you may
remember from the Preface, the &dagger; symbol
before the plural version means that the use of [.s le] to
address more than one person is from the _Lord of the Rings_
movies, not Tolkien's works.

In addition to [.s le], there is
a special "familiar" second person form [.s gin],
which you would only use when speaking one-on-one with
someone you're very close to. Because it's only used in
intimate conversation, there is no plural form. It's perhaps
worth noting that in the _Lord of the Rings_ films, the
familiar pronoun isn't used at all—so even when Arwen and
Aragorn are speaking to each other, they use [.s le].

In the third person, we have the gender-neutral [.s han]
(singular) and [.s hain] (plural). These pronouns can be
used for people, animals, and things. If you want to specify
a person's gender, there are also the pronouns [.s.salo hon]
"him" and [.s.salo hen] "her". The gendered pronouns come from
one of Tolkien's early revisions of the language, and it's not
clear if they were still part of Sindarin
at the time he was writing _The Lord of the Rings_. They
are used extensively in the films, though, so it's
useful to know them.

## Commands with Subjects

An imperative verb in Sindarin may also have a [.term subject]
referring to the person doing the action. This construction
is rare in English, but you can still see it in stage
directions: _Enter Aragorn stage left_. Here, "Enter" is the
imperative verb (it's telling Aragorn what to do), and
"Aragorn" is the subject.

This translates easily to Sindarin, keeping the same word
order:

!!example

[.s Minno Aragorn!] "Let Aragorn enter!"

[.s Pedo mellon!] "May a friend speak!"

/!

## The Interjection [.s A]

When giving someone a direct command or wishing them well
(or ill!) you can add the [.term interjection]
[.s A], which emphasizes the fact that you're directly
addressing a person. This can go before either the verb
or the subject, depending on which one you want to emphasize.

!!example

[.s Minno, A Aragorn!] "Enter, O Aragorn!"

[.s A minno, Aragorn!] "O enter, Aragorn!"

/!

Note that this interjection [.s A] is always capitalized
when writing Sindarin with our alphabet. This helps keep
it from being confused
with the word for "and", which is [.s a].

## Putting it all together

You can combine any or all of these techniques in a single
imperative sentence. The word order is _verb_,
_subject_, _direct object_, _person being addressed_.

!!example

[.s Berio Belain le, A Aragorn] "May the Valar protect you, O Aragorn"

[.s Tiro ven, Elbereth!] "Guard us, Elbereth!"

/!
