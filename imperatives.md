The [.term imperative] form of a verb is the form used for
directly telling someone to do something. In English, it's
the simplest verb form, with no endings added: _[.hi eat],
[.hi drink], and [.hi be] merry!_

In Sindarin, imperative verbs are used for commands and
wishes. Many examples can be found in _The Lord of the Rings_:

!!indented

- Glorfindel's cry to his horse Asfaloth: [.s Noro lim, noro lim Asfaloth!] No translation is given, but [.s noro lim] probably means "Run fast!"
- Haldir's command to the Fellowship in Lórien: [.s Daro!] "Halt!"
- Sam's invocation of Elbereth, which ends [.s A tiro nín, Fanuilos!] "O look towards me, Everwhite!"
- [.s Eglerio!]

/!

It's not hard to create the imperative form of a verb from its dictionary form: just add [.s o] to the end. If the dictionary form of the verb ends in an [.s a], drop the [.s a] before adding [.s o].

!!indented

- [.s linna-] "sing" &rarr; [.s linno]
- [.s car-] "do" or "make" &rarr; [.s caro]
- [.s beria-] "protect" &rarr; [.s berio]
- [.s cen-] "see" &rarr; [.s ceno]

## The dictionary verb-form

Sindarin wordlists almost always list verbs by a special
"dictionary form", which ends in a dash. The dictionary form
can't be used as-is; you have to add endings to use the
verb in a sentence.

## Direct Objects

Some verbs don't make a whole lot of sense without a target
or [.term direct object] for the action. For example, you
probably wouldn't say [.s berio!] "protect!" in Sindarin
without specifying *what* to protect. You'd generally say
something like [.s berio i pherian!] "protect the hobbits!", in
which case "the hobbits" would be the direct object.

The direct object can also be a [.term pronoun], like "her",
"him", or "me". The grammar for using pronouns
as direct objects is simpler than the grammar for using
nouns, so this lesson only covers pronouns.

The table below lists the pronouns you can use
as direct objects. As in English, they come after the
verb:

!!example

[.s Dago &dagger;hon!] "Kill him!"

[.s Aphado hain!] "Follow them!"

[.s Tiro nin!] "Watch me!"

/!

<table class="columns">
<tr class="head">
  <td></td>
  <td>Singular</td>
  <td>Plural</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1<sup>st</sup> person</td>
  <td>[.s nin] &ldquo;me&rdquo;</td>
  <td>[.s ven], [.s *&apos;wen] &ldquo;us&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2<sup>nd</sup> person</td>
  <td>[.s le], &ldquo;you&rdquo;</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2<sup>nd</sup> p. familiar</td>
  <td>[.s gin] &ldquo;you&rdquo;</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3<sup>rd</sup> person</td>
  <td>[.s han] "him/her/it", [.s &dagger;hon] "him", [.s &dagger;hen] "her"</td>
  <td>[.s hain] "them"</td>
</tr>
</table>

In Sindarin, as in English, the direct object usually follows the verb.

!!example

[.s Berio nin!] ~ "Protect the hobbits!"

[.s Anglenno i aran.] ~ "Approach the king."

[.s Leithio i philin!] ~ "Release the arrows!"

[.TODO it's not clear whether transitive verbs exist as a distinct category in Sindarin, or, if they do, whether they can be used intransitively in the sense of e.g. "protect (things in general)". The most conservative assumption is perhaps that transitive verbs do exist and cannot be used intransitively (unless examples of normally transitive verbs used intransitively exist). However, it should probably be made clear that this is a pretty big and limiting assumption.]
