The [.term imperative] form of a verb is the form used for
directly telling someone to do something. In English, it's
the simplest verb form, with no endings added: _[.hi eat],
[.hi drink], and [.hi be] merry!_

In Sindarin, imperative verbs are used for commands and
wishes. Many examples can be found in _The Lord of the Rings_:

!!indented

- Glorfindel's cry to his horse Asfaloth: [.s Noro lim, noro lim Asfaloth!] No translation is given, but [.s noro lim] probably means "Run fast!"
- Haldir's command to the Fellowship in Lórien: [.s Daro!] "Halt!"
- Sam's invocation of Elbereth, which ends [.s A tiro nín, Fanuilos!] "O look towards me, Everwhite!"
- [.s Eglerio!]

/!

It's not hard to create the imperative form of a verb from its dictionary form: just add [.s o] to the end. If the dictionary form of the verb ends in an [.s a], drop the [.s a] before adding [.s o].

!!indented

- [.s linna-] "sing" &rarr; [.s linno]
- [.s car-] "do" or "make" &rarr; [.s caro]
- [.s beria-] "protect" &rarr; [.s berio]
- [.s cen-] "see" &rarr; [.s ceno]

/!


## The dictionary verb-form

Sindarin wordlists almost always list verbs by a special
"dictionary form", which ends in a dash. The dictionary form
can't be used as-is; you have to add endings to use the
verb in a sentence.

## Direct Objects

Some verbs don't make a whole lot of sense without a target
or [.term direct object] for the action. For example, you
probably wouldn't say [.s berio!] "protect!" in Sindarin
without specifying *what* to protect. You'd generally say
something like [.s berio i pherian!] "protect the hobbits!", in
which case "the hobbits" would be the direct object.

The direct object can also be a [.term pronoun], like "her",
"him", or "me". The grammar for using pronouns
as direct objects is simpler than the grammar for using
nouns, so this lesson only covers pronouns.

The table below lists the pronouns you can use
as direct objects. As in English, they come after the
verb:

!!example

[.s Dago hon!] "Kill him!"

[.s Aphado hain!] "Follow them!"

[.s Tiro nin!] "Watch me!"

Many of these pronouns have no direct counterpart in English,
so they deserve some explanation.

The first person pronouns [.s ven] and [.s &rsquo;wen] both
mean "we", but they
differ in whether the person you're speaking to is included
or not. [.s ven] is the [.term exclusive first person]
form—it doesn't include the listener. It means, essentially,
"them and me (but not you)". [.s &rsquo;Wen], on the other
hand, is the [.term inclusive first person]. If you use this
form, you're _including_ the listener: the meaning is
"you and me (and possibly others)". As described in the
Preface, the asterisk (\*) before [.s &rsquo;wen] is not part of the word, but
means that this form is reconstructed rather than drawn
directly from Tolkien's works. The apostrophe *is* part of
the spelling—it indicates that a [.s G] that existed in the
ancient form of the language has been dropped.

The second person [.s le] "you" can be used whether you
are addressing one person or many. However, as you may
remember from the Preface, the &dagger; symbol
before the plural version means that the use of [.s le] to
address more than one person is from the _Lord of the Rings_
movies, not Tolkien's works.

In addition to the normal second person [.s le], there is
a special "familiar" form [.s gin],
which you would only use when speaking one-on-one with
someone you're very close to. Because it's only used in
intimate conversation, there is no plural form. It's perhaps
worth noting that in the _Lord of the Rings_ films, the
familiar pronoun isn't used at all—so even when Arwen and
Aragorn are speaking to each other, they use [.s le].

In the third person, we have the gender-neutral [.s han]
(singular) and [.s hain] (plural). These pronouns can be
used for people, animals, and things. If you want to specify
a person's gender, there are also the pronouns [.s.salo hon]
"him" and [.s.salo hen] "her". The gendered pronouns come from
one of Tolkien's early revisions of the language, and it's not
clear if they were still part of Sindarin
at the time he was writing _The Lord of the Rings_. They
are used extensively in the films, though, so it's
useful to know them.

## Commands with Subjects

An imperative verb in Sindarin may also have a [.term subject]
referring to the person doing the action. This construction
is rare in English, but you can still see it in stage
directions: _Enter Aragorn stage left_. Here, "Enter" is the
imperative verb (it's telling Aragorn what to do), and
"Aragorn" is the subject.

This translates easily to Sindarin, keeping the same word
order:

!!example

[.s Minno Aragorn!] "Enter, Aragorn!" or "Let Aragorn enter"

/!

For extra drama, you can add the [.term interjection]
[.s A], which emphasizes the fact that you're directly
addressing a person. This can go before either the verb
or the subject, depending on which one you want to emphasize.

!!example

[.s Minno, A Aragorn!] "Enter, O Aragorn!"

[.s A minno, Aragorn!] "O enter, Aragorn!"

/!

Note that this interjection [.s A] is always capitalized
when writing Sindarin with our alphabet. This helps keep
it from being confused
with the word for "and", which is [.s a].

[.TODO it's not clear whether transitive verbs exist as a distinct category in Sindarin, or, if they do, whether they can be used intransitively in the sense of e.g. "protect (things in general)". The most conservative assumption is perhaps that transitive verbs do exist and cannot be used intransitively (unless examples of normally transitive verbs used intransitively exist). However, it should probably be made clear that this is a pretty big and limiting assumption.]
