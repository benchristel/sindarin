Many of the _tengwar_ letters seem to be variations on a
theme: one or two loops and a long stem pointing up or down.
This is by design: the _tengwar_ are a partly [.term featural script],
in which the shape of a letter tells you how that letter sounds.
The regularity of the system can make memorizing
the _tengwar_ a bit easier.

Figure 1 shows the main _tengwar_ of the Brogan Mode, in the
arrangement traditionally used by the Elves. In this arrangement, the
patterns of sound and shape become evident.

## The Four _Témar_

The Elves grouped the _tengwar_ into four _témar_ (Quenya for "series"),
which are represented by the four columns of Figure 2.
Their names are, in order from left to right: _tincotéma_,
_parmatéma_, _calmatéma_, and _quessetéma_. The _témar_ are named
after their first letters [.t 1], [.t q], [.t a], and [.t z],
called _tinco_ "metal", _parma_ "book", _calma_ "lamp", and _quessë_ "feather" in Quenya.
The Elves considered these four letters to be the
fundamental _tengwar_-shapes. The other _tengwar_ in Figure 2 are
variations on the four basic shapes.

## The Six _Tyeller_

The six rows of Figure 2 correspond to the six _tyeller_ or  "grades"
of letters recognized by the Elves. Each _tyellë_ was used
for sounds of a specific quality.

### The First Row

The letters of the first row, [.t 1], [.t q], [.t a], and [.t z],
represent unvoiced [.term plosives]. These sounds
stop the breath completely and release it suddenly with a little pop.
See the section on pronunciation [.TODO link] for an
explanation of voiced vs. unvoiced sounds.

### The Second Row

The second row is formed by doubling the _lúva_ or "bow" of
the fundamental letters. This adds [.term voice] or vocal
cord vibration to the
sound, making the "pop" a bit duller. Thus we get the sounds
of [.t 2], [.t w], and [.t x] ([.t s] isn't used in the
English mode).

### The Third and Fourth Rows

These rows are formed from the first two by extending the
_telco_ or "stem" of each letter upward. This makes the
sounds into [.term fricatives], which constrict the flow
of breath but don't quite stop it. This results in a sound
like a fizz (if unvoiced) or a buzz (if voiced). As in the
first two rows, voice is added to a sound if the _lúva_ is
doubled.

The resulting sounds are unvoiced [.t 3] TH (as in _cloth_), [.t e] F, [.t d] SH,
and [.t c] CH, and voiced [.t 4] TH (as in _clothes_), [.t r] V,
and [.t f] J.

### The Fifth and Sixth Rows

In the last two rows, the _telco_ is shortened to be the
same height as the _lúvar_. The Elves typically used these
letters for [.term nasal consonants] like N, M, and NG.

Here, the doubled _lúva_ again corresponds to a voiced
sound, but the single-_lúva_ letters are not their unvoiced
counterparts.
The major Elvish languages lacked unvoiced nasals (as does English),
so these letters were generally pressed into service as vowels. In some
modes they were used for
[.term semivowels] like Y and W. The Brogan mode follows
this tradition and assigns vowel sounds to these letters.

The sound R might seem out of place here, but in many
dialects of English it behaves almost like a vowel: consider
a word like _turn_, where the R-sound dominates and the U hardly
registers.

## The _Quessë_ Variations

The English mode uses two modified versions of the letter _quessë_ ([.t z]):
[.t zê] and [.t z|]. In some Elvish modes, a mark like a flattened S above
a letter indicated a following W; thus the use of [.t zê] for KW (= QU).
The curl below the letter in [.t z|] indicates a following S (it's
meant to be reminiscent of the _tengwa_ for S, [.t 8]); thus [.t z|]
has the sound KS (= X).

## The Other Tengwar

There are, of course, several _tengwar_ that don't fit into
the pattern of Figure 1, including [.t 7] W, [.t j] L, and
[.t 9] H. These must simply be memorized.

## Terminology in This Chapter

The Elvish terms here are Quenya, not Sindarin. This is because the _tengwar_ were invented by Fëanor, a Quenya-speaking Elf, and only used for Sindarin much later in Middle-earth's history.

- [.s tengwa] — literally "sign", this refers to a single Elvish letter. The plural, [.s tengwar] "signs", is the word used to refer to the whole writing system.
- [.s tehta] — a mark written above a _tengwa_. When writing English, they represent vowels. The plural is _tehtar_.
- [.s telco] — literally "stem"; the vertical line that forms the backbone of many _tengwar_. The plural is [.s telqui].
- [.s lúva] — literally "bow"; the curved part of _tengwar_ that have a _telco_. The plural is [.s lúvar].
- [.s coronal consonant] — a sound that involves the front of the tongue touching the upper teeth, or the roof of the mouth just behind the upper teeth. Examples include T, TH, D, and N.
- [.s labial consonant] — a sound that involves closing or constricting the lips. Examples: P, F, B, and M.
- [.s velar consonant] — a sound that involves the back of the tongue touching the _velum_, or soft palate, at the back of the mouth.
- [.s palatal consonant] — a sound that involves contact between the tongue and the hard palate, near the middle of the roof of the mouth.
