## About the Sindarin Language

Sindarin is the language of the [.q.att Sindar] or Grey-elves, who after awaking at Cuiviénen, traveled west to Beleriand, settling there rather than voyaging across the sea to Aman with the rest of their kin. At the time at which _The Lord of the Rings_ takes place, Sindarin was already an ancient language, but still widely used among the Elves. Many of the names of people and places in _The Lord of the Rings_ are Sindarin in origin, and the book also contains some longer passages in the language. The elves of Rivendell sing a hymn to Elbereth in Sindarin:

## Related Languages

Sindarin differs notably from its sister language Quenya, which also appears in _The Lord of the Rings_. While Tolkien modeled many aspects of Sindarin after Welsh, Quenya was inspired more by the sounds of Finnish and Latin. Quenya is the language of Galadriel's lament in Lórien (which begins [.q.att Ai laurië lantar lassi súrinen...]) as well as a few other utterances and terms found throughout the book, largely in the Appendices. Quenya is, at least for the time being, outside the scope of this site, but there are many other resources available if you wish to learn about it. Two of the best are Thorsten Renk's site <a href="http://www.science-and-fiction.org/elvish/index.html">[.q Parma Tyelpelassiva]</a> (Quenya for "Book of Silver Leaves") and Helge Fauskanger's <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/">[.q Ardalambion]</a> (Quenya: "Of the Tongues of Arda"). [.q Parma Tyelpelassiva] has, in my opinion, the best available Quenya textbook for beginners. [.q Ardalambion] has more in-depth information on Tolkien's creative process, and boasts a Quenya course of its own that is a little less beginner-friendly but full of insightful analysis.

Quenya and Sindarin are the two Elvish languages about which we have the most information, but Tolkien also wrote (in less detail) about many of the other languages of Middle-earth, including Westron, the language spoken by hobbits and Gondorians, and the Black Speech of Sauron, in which the inscription on the One Ring was written. <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/">[.q Ardalambion]</a> has probably the best available summaries of what we know about these langauges.

<!-- Sometimes the use of Quenya words is unavoidable, since many Elvish linguistic terms are drawn from Quenya&mdash;for example, [.q tengwar], the usual name of the best-known Elvish writing system. To make it clear that these words are Quenya and not Sindarin, I have printed them in [.q this color]. -->
