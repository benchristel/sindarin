- [The Great Migration](./todo.html) – [.toc-detail When Tolkien decided that his Celtic-style language (then called Noldorin) was actually spoken by the Sindar, he also changed its sounds and grammar. Here I review the changes and draw some conclusions about the relationship between Sindarin and Noldorin.]
- [Summary of Sindarin Consonant Mutations](./todo.html) – [.toc-detail All the mutations, in one place.]
- [Write Your Name in Elvish Letters](./todo.html) – [.toc-detail how to use the _tengwar_ and runic scripts to write English]
- [ELFLANG 101](./todo.html) – [.toc-detail If you're just beginning to study Elvish, it's easy to feel that you're facing an endless onslaught of new terms and concepts. Some of these come from Tolkien's fiction, others from the field of linguistics, and still others from the scholars who study Tolkien's work. ELFLANG 101 tries to demystify the study of Elvish languages and provide a map of what's already been written about them.]

alternative: [.toc-detail Scholars of Elvish have by now written much more about the languages than Tolkien himself ever did. If you're new to the party, this huge body of work can be daunting, especially since much of it is outdated or misleading and needs to be taken with a grain or two of salt. ELFLANG 101 is an introduction to Tolkien's work and creative process as well as the work of post-Tolkien scholars. ]
