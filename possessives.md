convenient to organize them into a tidy table, like this:

## Word Order

In English, possessive pronouns precede the noun they're
modifying, but in Sindarin they follow it: _[.hi my]
book_ vs. [.s parf <span class="hi">nîn</span>].

## Using the Pronouns

The Sindarin pronouns don't correspond one-to-one with
English pronouns, so care is required when translating. The
next few sections describe how to translate each
English possessive pronoun to Sindarin.

### My

The Sindarin word for "my" is simple enough: [.s nîn].

!!example

[.s bâr nîn] "my home"

[.s glim nîn] "my voice"

/!

### Our

There are two words in Sindarin corresponding to the English
pronoun "our": [.s vîn] and [.s 'wîn]. (Technically, these are both
mutated forms: the dictionary forms are [.s mîn] and
[.s gwîn]. However, these pronouns are always mutated in actual
usage.)

[.s Vîn] is the [.term exclusive] form—used
when the person you're talking to is not included in the
"us" group.

!!example

[.s Noss vîn] "our family" (speaking to someone who is not a member of the family)

[.s Govannas vîn] "our fellowship" (speaking to someone who is not a member of the fellowship)

/!

[.s 'Win], on the other hand, is the [.term inclusive] form,
used when the person you're addressing is a member of the
"us" group.

!!example

[.s Govaned 'wîn] "our meeting" (speaking to the person you met)

[.s Noss 'wîn] "our family" (speaking to a member of your family)

/!


### Your

Second-person pronouns in Sindarin distinguish between two
types of social situations: the [.term familiar] form is
used when talking to a child, a family member, or a close
friend, while the [.term formal] form is used with everyone
else.

!!example

[.s bâr gîn] "your home" (speaking to a loved one)

[.s bâr lîn] "your home" (speaking to an acquaintance)

/!

Note that the familiar pronoun [.s gîn] is a mutated form;
the dictionary form is [.s cîn].

The formal second-person pronoun [.s lîn] is the same
regardless of how many people you're addressing:

!!example

[.s bâr lîn] "your home" (speaking to one person)

[.s bâr lîn] "your home" (speaking to a crowd)

/!

The familiar pronoun has no plural form. [.s Lîn] is used
to mean "your", even when speaking to a group of people
you're close to.

!!example

[.s bâr lîn] "your home" (speaking to your whole family)

/!

What if you use the wrong second-person pronoun with
someone? If you use [.s gîn] with a stranger, you're
treating them like a child—belittling them. Using the
"wrong" form intentionally can therefore be a subtle way
to insult someone.

On the other hand, using the formal form with a loved one
distances you from them, perhaps hinting that you wish your
relationship with them were ended.

## His, Her, Its, Their

Third-person pronouns are one area of Sindarin grammar where
it's especially hard to piece together a consistent picture
from Tolkien's notes. As a result, there are as many
different analyses of the third-person pronouns as there are
Sindarin scholars.

In my analysis, the third-person pronouns don't
distinguish gender or number. The word [.s dîn] (mutated;
the dictionary form is [.s tîn]) can mean "its", "his",
"her", or "their".

However, there's a special [.term reflexive] pronoun [.s în]
that's used when the possessor is the [.term subject] of the
sentence. This distinction may seem subtle, but it's
sometimes important. For example:

!!example

[.s Aragorn suila Théoden a mâb i roch în]<br>"Aragorn greets Théoden and takes his own (Aragorn's) horse"

&nbsp;

[.s Aragorn suila Théoden a mâb i roch dîn]<br>"Aragorn greets Théoden and takes his (Théoden's) horse"

/!

Whether or not Aragorn is a horse-thief in this scenario
depends on the pronoun you choose.

In English, we sometimes make a similar distinction using
"own": _his own horse_ seems to refer unambiguously to
_Aragorn's horse_.

## The Definite Article and Possessives

In English, you can't use both a possessive pronoun and an
article like "a" or "the" on the same noun. For instance,
you can say "a friend", "the friend", or "my friend", but
not "a my friend" or "the my friend".

Not so in Sindarin! It's very common to say something like
[.s i vellon nîn] "my friend", combining both the definite
article [.s i] and the possessive pronoun [.s nîn].

Perhaps the easiest way to explain this construction is by
looking at what happens when you leave out the article
[.s i]. [.s Mellon nîn], for example, means
"a friend of mine" or "one of my friends". That
is, it implies the friend in question is a new topic of
conversation, and makes no assumption that your audience
knows which friend you're talking about.

On the other hand, [.s i vellon nîn] means you're talking
about one specific friend, and it's the same friend you've
already been talking about.

One notable case where you *don't* use the definite article
is when directly addressing someone. For
instance, when addressing your audience as "my
friend", just say [.s mellon nîn].

## Movie-Sindarin Pronouns

Pronouns are one area where the Sindarin used in the _Lord
of the Rings_ films differs significantly from our current
understanding of the language. We simply didn't know much
about Sindarin pronouns in the early 2000s, when the movies
were being produced.

For starters, movie-Sindarin makes no
distinction between the inclusive and exclusive first person
pronouns; "our" is always [.s vîn].

Additionally, characters in the movies use only
the formal second-person pronouns. Even when Arwen and
Aragorn are talking to each other, they use [.s lîn].

The table for Movie-Sindarin possessive pronouns looks like
this:

<table class="columns">
<tr class="head">
  <td></td>
  <td>Singular Possessor</td>
  <td>Plural Poss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1<sup>st</sup> person</td>
  <td>[.s nîn] &ldquo;my&rdquo;</td>
  <td>[.s vîn] &ldquo;our&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2<sup>nd</sup> person</td>
  <td>[.s lîn] &ldquo;your&rdquo;</td>
  <td>[.s lîn] &ldquo;your&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td rowspan="2">3<sup>rd</sup> person</td>
  <td>[.s dîn] &ldquo;his, her, its, their&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>[.s în] &ldquo;his/her/their own&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
</table>

## A Note on Accents

You'll notice that each of these pronouns contains a long
(accented) vowel. Tolkien was inconsistent about indicating
this. Sometimes, he used a circumflex, sometimes an acute
accent (e.g. [.s nín]) and sometimes no accent at all.

## Using Nouns as Possessors

The possessor in a phrase doesn't have to be a pronoun. It
can be a noun, as in _the king's ship_, _a bird's nest_. In
English, you can indicate a possessive relationship by
adding _&rsquo;s_ to the possessor, or by using a
construction with _of_: _the boat of the moon_.

In Sindarin, there's just one way to form this type of
possessive: put the possessor after the thing possessed.
The word order is the same as the English construction with
"of", except the "of" is dropped.

!!example

[.s talan ][.s.hi aew] &ldquo;nest of <span class="hi">a bird</span>&rdquo;

[.s cair ][.s.hi aran] &ldquo;ship of <span class="hi">a king</span>&rdquo;

[.s lhunt ][.s.hi Ithil] &ldquo;boat of <span class="hi">the Moon</span>&rdquo;

/!

When the possessor is [.term definite] (i.e. when you'd
use the definite article "the" in English), you have a choice:
You can use either the regular definite article [.s i], or
a special possessive form [.s en]. When using [.s en], the
words are often connected with dashes:

!!example

[.s Cabed-en-Aras] "Leap of the Deer (a river gorge in Beleriand)"

[.s Condir i Drann] "Mayor of the Shire"

/!

The possessive article [.s en] causes the following word
to mutate. This type of mutation is called the
[.term mixed mutation], because it combines elements of both soft
mutation and nasal mutation (which we haven't seen yet).
An additional complication is that the [.s en] itself
sometimes changes to [.s e] or [.s edh].

The mixed mutation is as follows:

  <td><span class="s">trann &rarr; en-drann</span> &ldquo;of the shire&rdquo;</td>

</table>

For words that began with nasalized plosives in Old
Sindarin, the mixed mutation brings the nasalized plosive
back:

<table class="columns">
<tr class="head">
  <td>Original &rarr; Mutated</td>
  <td>Example</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>EN B &rarr; E-MB</td>
  <td><span class="s">bâr &rarr; e-mbar</span> &ldquo;of the home&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>EN D &rarr; E-ND</td>
  <td><span class="s">dîr &rarr; e-ndîr</span> &ldquo;of the man&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>EN G &rarr; E-ÑG</td>
  <td><span class="s">galad &rarr; e-ñgalad</span> &ldquo;of the light&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
</table>

These consonant clusters look scary, but aren't—they can
simply be pronounced as if the dash weren't there:
[.s embâr], [.s endîr], [.s engalad].

Of course, you can avoid all that complexity by just using
the definite article [.s i] when forming the possessive. You
*will* need the mixed mutation later, though, so you might
as well get a head start on it now.
