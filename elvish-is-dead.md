# Elvish Is Dead; Long Live Elvish

In January of 2002, I received an issue of _Muse_ magazine whose cover story was titled in an unfamiliar language: _Ma quetelyë [sic] i eldalambë?_—meaning, I soon discovered, "Do you speak Elvish?" The language was Quenya, invented by J.R.R. Tolkien and used in his epic novel _The Lord of the Rings_, and although the magazine focused on the film adaptation of _The Fellowship of the Ring_ (which had just been released the previous month) I was inspired, in accordance with an ancient tradition that I may or may not have made up at that moment, to read the book before watching the movie. I had attempted the journey into Middle-earth twice before, out of a vague curiosity and a feeling that I was missing out on a cultural touchstone, but this time I had a stronger motivation. If anyone ever asked me "Ma quetelyë i eldalambë", I wanted to respond (in Quenya, of course) "Yes!"

Fast-forward thirteen years, and I still don't know how to say "yes" in Quenya. No one does. It's a paradoxical fact that the Elvish languages, held up by Tolkien and his critics alike as the element that, more than any other, made Middle-earth feel "real", are full of holes and inconsistencies that thwart even trivial attempts to converse in them. During those thirteen years, through many attempts to learn Quenya (and, later, Sindarin, Tolkien's other main Elvish language), I discovered this, and came at last to comprehend that the task I had set for myself was not possible.

But despair not! Before you hit the back button on your browser and forget your dreams of learning Elvish forever, you should know that this story has a happy ending. I will get there in time. The turning point comes when I realize that I had made an error, a rather fundamental one, that prevented me from seeing the way forward. But not so hasty! First, let me describe what I was doing for those thirteen years that I was trying and failing to learn Tolkien's languages.

It certainly seemed *possible*, at the beginning at any rate, to learn Quenya and Sindarin. My lack of progress was due to no fault in my instructors' teaching ability, nor to lack of aptitude on my part. It was due to the fact that I kept giving up, over and over again. I would learn a bit of Elvish, try to use it in a sentence or maybe a longer composition, and become increasingly frustrated by it. Although my instructors and fellow students reassured me that my grammar was correct, the sentences I produced didn't *feel* right. They were clumsy and ugly and entirely different from the passages I loved from _The Lord of the Rings_, despite being built from words found in dictionaries that cited Tolkien's works. And so I repeatedly concluded that the languages were not actually as I had first thought them to be; that I had ascribed to them a type of beauty that they did not in fact possess.

In between bouts of learning Sindarin and Quenya (I alternated between the two, with the changing winds of my aesthetic preference), I struck out on my own, sketching new invented languages and dabbling in many real-world ones. I always came back to Tolkien's languages, though. My obstinance, together with the evidence of the Elvish phrases in _The Lord of the Rings_, made me unwilling to believe that my first impressions had been false. After many years of this cycle, I convinced myself that the languages I loved were illusions and that there was no real purpose to learning them anyway, and put my studies on the shelf indefinitely.

The "indefinite" period turned out to last only about a year, for Tolkien's languages again caught my attention from a slightly different angle. I had bought a copy of David Salo's _A Gateway to Sindarin_ after skimming the preview on Google and discovering, to my great delight, that it contained the complete series of sound changes between Common Eldarin and Sindarin. I had long known that the secret ingredient in Tolkien's linguistic concoctions was *time*: he did not simply make up Quenya or Sindarin words at random, but created words in a common ancestor of both languages, according to strict derivational rules. He would then simulate, also according to regular rules, the development of those words through the entire history of Elvish speech, until he arrived at the forms that Frodo might have heard in Rivendell or Lothlórien. It was through these sound shifts that the rich and unique flavor of each language was achieved. Seeing them spelled out with mathematical clarity in Salo's book, I saw my path clear before me: I would use Salo's work to construct a computer program that would carry out Tolkien's simulation of language change on a massive scale. My program would derive not only the Sindarin and Quenya forms of each primitive root, but all the intermediate forms as well, and check them for correctness against every word of every form of Elvish that Tolkien ever penned. The result would be a computational model of the Eldarin language family, inescapably consistent and demonstrably correct with respect to the words that Tolkien actually wrote. I felt certain that such a model was achievable, and also certain that it would yield the most accurate possible description of Tolkien's languages.

I did not realize the hubris of this endeavor for several hours. One of the first sources I combed for ancient Eldarin words was _The Etymologies_, a posthumously-published wordlist describing how hundreds of Elvish words changed over the history of Middle-earth. At some point I read Christopher Tolkien's introduction to it, and my ambitions were quickly quenched by the statement that "finality and a system fixed at every point were not [J.R.R. Tolkien's] underlying aim". I read on and my heart sank further. Within the single document that constitutes the manuscript for the Etymologies, there are layers upon layers of struck-out entries and revisions, pencilled notes, cryptic jottings, illegible words, and a copious variety of spelling conventions. Only then did I begin to understand that the data for Quenya and Sindarin are not merely fragmentary, they are not even self-consistent. Tolkien's languages are characterized, in the real world as in the fictional one, by constant and rapid change.

I hope to make Sindarin accessible to any lover of Tolkien's works. This cannot really be done by creating a "Teach Yourself"-style course in the language, because such a course will inevitably stray towards non-Tolkien examples and misleading comparisons between Sindarin and English (or whatever language the course is written in). As Carl Hostetter points out in "Elvish As She Is Spoke", these faults are serious; they obscure the difference between Tolkien's own Sindarin and fan-made Sindarins, leading to circular reasoning (e.g. arguing that a particular grammatical construction is "correct" based on non-Tolkien examples) and clumsy word-by-word translations.

It might be possible to develop a variety of Neo-Sindarin that could be used for conversation, but that goal is impractical in more ways than one. For all the attempts that have been made to develop Sindarin and Quenya into "usable" Neo-Elvish forms, they have no community of fluent speakers, so if you learned to speak one of the Neo-Elvish languages there would be almost no one who could understand you. And any Neo-Elvish sufficiently complete to be "usable" would necessarily be unfaithful to Tolkien's thoughts on the languages and his intentions for them. (cite Letters cf. Hostetter and English and Welsh re: the effects of daily usage)

So a traditional "Learn to Speak Sindarin" course is not my aim. But neither do I want to write a formal grammar—I doubt most of my readers would want to read it, and we don't know enough about Sindarin to write a comprehensive grammar anyway. Instead, I want to attempt something subtly but significantly different from a normal language course: rather than have the primary question be "How do you say X in Elvish?", I want to first ask "What can we say in Elvish, based on the examples from Tolkien's works?" This approach is likelier to yield a description of Sindarin that is true to Tolkien's intentions. The language described in this way will be sparse, but still expressive. Ultimately, if you read all the articles on this site, you will not be able to speak Sindarin the way you currently speak English, but you _will_ be able to speak Sindarin the way Gandalf (for instance) speaks it in _The Lord of the Rings_, and that is perhaps better.
