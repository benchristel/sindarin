# _Mae govannen!_

If you've picked up this book, I assume I don't need to introduce you to J.R.R. Tolkien. Maybe you've read _The Hobbit_ or _The Lord of the Rings_. Maybe both. Perhaps you've begun the _Silmarillion_, but found it hard to get through the forest of "eye-splitting Celtic names," to borrow the words of one critic. Or maybe you've only made it through the first few chapters of _The Lord of the Rings_ and put it down wondering what all the fuss is about. That was my situation, years ago.

When I first picked up The _Lord of the Rings_ at the age of ten or eleven, my first impression was of an adventure story, but an adventure story devoid of the humor that made The Hobbit so delightful. The enemies in LotR are (rightly) devoid of whimsy, but also lack character or motivation other than "evil". A thousand pages of war against such a foe didn't seem like my cup of tea—afternoon or elevenses. So I decided to cheat: I flipped through to the back of the book, to see how it ended. And what confronted me was not a climactic duel between Frodo and Sauron, but this:

Those are, of course, the forms of the _tengwar_, the Elvish letters. They can be found in the midst of the hundred-odd pages that make up the Appendices to _LotR_—pages that describe peoples and geneologies and calendars, and above all *languages*. The Appendices gave me the sense that Tolkien's real goal with _LotR_ was not to tell the story of Frodo or Sauron but *to create the world in which those stories could be told*. I reread _The Lord of the Rings_ with a new purpose: to discover Middle-earth. My reward was immeasurable.

What I discovered was what many others have discovered: Tolkien invented languages. Marvelous, intricate, beautiful languages. A New York Times columnist once asked Tolkien about the origins of his work. Tolkien replied "I am a philologist, [i.e. a historical linguist] and all my work is philological". He later clarified in a letter to his publisher: "the remark about <q>philology</q> was intended to allude to what I think is a primary <q>fact</q> about my work, that it is all of a piece, and <em>fundamentally linguistic</em> in inspiration. [. . .] The invention of languages is the foundation. The <q>stories</q> were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in <q>Elvish</q>." In light of such strong statements, it should be clear that we can only hope to understand Tolkien's work if we share, or at least acknowledge, his passion for language.

However, Tolkien never shared this passion readily. He was always rather shy and self-deprecating about his language-creation habit, calling it a "secret vice" and a "mad hobby". He never published any grammars or vocabularies of the Elvish languages—perhaps because he thought no one would buy them, but also because he loved the total creative freedom that he had as a language inventor. Publishing information about Elvish would have forced him to get the languages into a "final" form, and that was something he could never bring himself to do. For Tolkien, the fun of invented languages was in the process of creation, not in using the finished product. He invented many more words than he ever used in Elvish poetry or prose.

Of course, we non-Tolkien people can't experience the joy of *creating* the Elvish languages. But we can *discover* them, and since our eyes are, as it were, newly woken to Middle-earth, our experience will be fresher and keener than even the experience of a creator.

## Tolkien's Languages

Tolkien imagined many different languages being spoken in Arda, but he really developed only two of them: the Elvish tongues **Quenya** and **Sindarin**. Quenya and Sindarin are sibling languages—Tolkien imagined that they developed from a common ancestor, much as French and Spanish both developed from Latin. He even worked out the evolution of each language in some detail. Since the languages are related we can use what we know about Quenya to make educated guesses about the grammar and vocabulary of Sindarin, and vice versa.

Tolkien's real-world inspiration for Quenya were Finnish and Latin. Quenya uses lots of L's and rolled R's, and most words end in a vowel: ***Ai laurië lantar lassi súrinen / Yéni únótimë ve rámar aldaron / Yéni ve lintë yuldar avánier***

Sindarin was inspired by Welsh. Most words end in a consonant, and the hard consonants **T**, **P**, and **K** favored by Quenya were often "softened" to **D**, **B**, and **G** during the fictional development of Sindarin. Sindarin also has the sound **TH**, which was replaced by **S** in Quenya.

***Ennyn Durin Aran Moria: Pedo mellon a minno. Im Narvi hain echant. Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thîw hin.***

This book is about Sindarin—though I refer frequently to Quenya words and constructions that help shed light on Sindarin.

In Middle-earth the role of Sindarin was similar to that of Mandarin in modern China. The standard form, Classical Sindarin, was a learned or courtly language among both Elves and Men, though there were also many dialects that were _mutually intelligible_: speakers of one dialect could generally understand the other dialects. While Sindarin was widely used, it was not the native language of many Elves. Local languages, distantly related to Sindarin, were more common mother-tongues.

Tolkien based the sound and general aesthetic of Sindarin on Welsh—a language he encountered in childhood and quickly fell in love with. For a long time—the 1930s and early 40s—Tolkien called his Welsh-flavored language Noldorin. Shortly before _The Lord of the Rings_ was published, Tolkien made a sweeping revision to Noldorin, changing some of its sounds and its place within Middle-earth's history—he now imagined it being spoken by a different group of Elves, the _Sindar_, so it was renamed _Sindarin_.

The revision from Noldorin to Sindarin is a major event for modern scholars of Elvish. A lot of our "Sindarin" vocabulary is actually only documented during the Noldorin phase! We can generally assume that Noldorin words are valid in Sindarin, often with some minor changes to certain sounds, but of course there are exceptions.

## Why This Book?

Other books (and many websites) that claim to teach Elvish exist. Why start with this book?

Most of the other resources are structured as **language courses**: they start out with some basic phrases and vocabulary, and gradually build up from there, giving examples of sentences and dialogue to illustrate the points. By the end of the course, you have not only an understanding of the grammar, but a feel for how to use the language in your own compositions.

Now, Tolkien himself never published descriptions of his languages, and the few snippets of Elvish poetry and prose in his writings hardly cover all the details of grammar. So where do these courses get their information?

We can get a long way toward a speakable language by making some *educated guesses*. By analyzing the patterns in the language samples we *do* have, we can fill the gaps in the grammar, smooth over the inconsistencies, and add new vocabulary. David Salo, who wrote the Elvish dialogue and lyrics for the Peter Jackson movies, is perhaps the foremost expert on this process. His book, _A Gateway to Sindarin_, takes a step toward a "finished" Elvish language by describing Sindarin almost as if it were a real language of our own Earth. We'd like to imagine that the result is close to what Tolkien himself might have published if he'd collected all his writings into a Sindarin grammar.

The problem is, Tolkien never had plans to publish a Sindarin grammar. He never intended his languages to be "finished" or spoken by anyone except the characters in his books. He saw the languages as a form of artistic expression. Making the languages usable was unrelated to that goal. And that means that there is never going to be a canonical, authentically Tolkien-made language that can also be spoken fluently.

So if we want to "learn Tolkien's Elvish", we're left with a dilemma. If we work only from the Tolkien-made examples, we don't have enough material to make a usable language. We've "learned Tolkien" but we haven't "learned Elvish". If we try to fill in the gaps, we end up with a language that is not genuine Tolkien—that is in fact genuinely un-Tolkienian in purpose. We've "learned Elvish" but disregarded Tolkien.

You might be wondering at this point which path you'd rather take. The purpose of this book is to make it so that you don't have to decide once and for all. You can learn about Tolkien's writings, or about how we might use them to "complete" Sindarin, as you like. This book describes both possibilities.

I've divided this book into three major sections: _Roots_, _Branches_, and _Scattered Seeds_.

_Roots_ lays a solid foundation for the study of Sindarin. It describes the parts of the language about which we're relatively certain: features that are evidenced all over Tolkien's writings and remained consistent throughout his life.

_Branches_ describes the areas of the language where Tolkien just couldn't make up his mind. Often, we know Tolkien considered multiple options for a particular piece of the grammar, but it's not clear which one he settled on or if he even did settle on anything. In this case, I think it's best to describe the alternatives and their ramifications.

_Scattered Seeds_ is about the cases where we have a single, isolated example of a word. It also covers various extensions that people have made to create a more usable form of Sindarin. David Salo's movie-Sindarin is covered here.

Samples in published works are treated as authoritative, even if there are no corroborating examples. In these cases, the evidence is open to interpretation but the fact that it *is* evidence, representing Tolkien's long-term intentions, is not in doubt.

In unpublished works, the path is a little less certain. I generally don't regard isolated examples from Tolkien's private notes as being anything more than a suggestion of what he was thinking at one moment in time. After all, he never intended these notes for publication, and his creative process involved a lot of experimentation. However, if multiple examples exist from different years or conceptual phases, that's a strong indication of a stable language feature. Where multiple data points exist and form a pattern, I treat that as authoritative evidence.

Somewhere in between is evidence from Tolkien's letters. Here we find language features that Tolkien had worked out enough to tell someone else about, but maybe would not have published to the world at large. I treat evidence from the letters as authoritative.

The supposed "fundamentals" in these courses are constantly shifting under our feet as new material is published by the Tolkien Estate. Thorsten Renk's course _Pedin Edhellen_ has been revised several times over the last decade as new information has come out. This is not a criticism of Renk or his work. Rather, he should be commended for his long-term commitment to keeping his courses up-to-date. However, it must frustrate his readers when the dialogue in the very first chapter of the course is revised, and with it the grammar rules it is supposed to demonstrate. This shows that the concepts he presents as foundational to the grammar are not really foundational to Tolkien's use of the language. In many cases they are far from certain. Someone who reads only the first few chapters of Renk's course will not learn much about Tolkien's Sindarin, only about Renk's interpretation of the currently available data—which, while interesting and valuable, is probably not what most of his readers believe they are getting.



My goal with this book is to present an Elvish language in a way that acknowledges the peculiar difficulties of Tolkien's languages and works through them in an accessible and balanced way. By "difficulties" I don't mean hard-to-pronounce words or complex grammar. The main difficulty is that Tolkien's languages aren't fixed, static entities; Tolkien was constantly revising them, in broad strokes and in detail, throughout his life, and they never stabilized. Furthermore, there are some details that Tolkien never worked out: these leave gaps in the language that can only be filled by guesswork.

The inconsistencies and missing pieces of the language can certainly be patched up, but anyone who presents such a "restored" version of the language as Tolkien canon is at best oversimplifying the facts, and at worst misrepresenting them. The main difficulty in writing about Elvish is that presenting and analyzing all the data would produce a treatise of mind-boggling complexity, while simplifying the language to a primer for students misrepresents Tolkien's work and usurps his place as the sole creator of his world.




My main criticism of the other available resources is that they don't take the peculiar difficulties of the Elvish languages into account. They are usually written either in the style of a foreign language course, or as a historical grammar of a dead language. The problem is that Tolkien's languages aren't fixed, static entities that can be cleanly described in a course or a grammar. Tolkien was constantly revising his languages to suit his own aesthetic whims, and many of the details of Elvish were simply never worked out.

This isn't to say that the gaps can't be plausibly filled. The wonderful thing about languages is that they follow regular patterns, so we can use patterns in one part of the language to make guesses about how another part should work. It's a bit like reconstructing a damaged painting or a fresco—we can't hope to get all the details exactly as the original artist did, but at least we can get close.



The problem is that Tolkien's languages are emphatically _not like_ the languages of our own earth—not because their words or grammar are particularly strange, but because they serve a different purpose. On Earth, we use languages to communicate with each other, and also to define social groups. Tolkien designed his languages to be _beautiful_, not useful

-



He probably had further remarks on the subject of philology, but none made it into the column, so the one sentence that remained probably did more to confuse than to enlighten those who read it. To avert further confusion, Tolkien wrote to his publishers with some remarks they could send to anyone else with inquiries about his work





> In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
> <cite>J.R.R. Tolkien, _The Hobbit_</cite>

So begins (for many of us) our first glimpse of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. But _The Hobbit_ is not where Middle-earth began for Tolkien. His fantasy world had much deeper roots. Before writing _The Hobbit_ he penned stories of elves and angelic Valar, of calamitous battles and the rise and fall of kingdoms. And those stories had roots as well: in the legend of Atlantis, the Old English epic of Beowulf, and the Finnish _Kalevala_. But if we delve even deeper, we find that the real kernel of Tolkien's genius was not his stories. It was his _languages_.

J.R.R. Tolkien created languages—fantastical, intricate, beautiful languages. And since languages need people to speak them, he invented those too, and started writing stories about them. From early on he framed his languages as being spoken by creatures of myth: first "Gnomes" and later the Elves of _The Lord of the Rings_.

Tolkien wasn't the first person to singlehandedly create a language. In the decade before Tolkien's birth, grammars of two artificial languages were published: L. L. Zamenhof's _Unua Libro_ for his language _Esperanto_, and Johann Martin Schleyer's book on _Volapük_. Both languages were intended to be mediums of international communication—simple, familiar-seeming, and easy to learn. Tolkien's goal was different. His goal for the Elvish languages was not to make them easy to speak, or indeed speakable at all. He wanted his languages to be beautiful. He wanted to create art.

There was a problem, or at the very least a complication: Tolkien's idea of what was "beautiful" in a language changed throughout his life, constantly. As a result he never got his languages into a "finished" state where he could write a whole grammar and dictionary for them. To do so was never his aim. As a result, there are gaps, often large gaps, in our knowledge of Tolkien's languages, and our uncertainty is compounded by the many different incompatible versions of each language that Tolkien created, sequentially, over the course of nearly 60 years.




He worked on them whenever his harrowing schedule would allow it, using whatever materials were at hand—the back of an envelope, a postcard, a stack of waste paper from his publisher.

In a letter to his wife Edith, 24-year-old Tolkien wrote "I have done some touches to my nonsense fairy-language [. . .] I often long to work at it and don't let myself 'cause though I love it so it does seem such a mad hobby!" [.citation Letters #4] Mad or not, the hobby grew to astonishing dimensions and bore fabulous fruit, though Tolkien never quite got over his shyness when it came to sharing his languages with the world.

- readers would have liked more languages
- Tolkien was adamant that his languages and names not be adapted for translations
