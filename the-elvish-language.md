# _Mae govannen!_

If you've picked up this book, I assume I don't need to introduce you to J.R.R. Tolkien. Maybe you've read _The Hobbit_ or _The Lord of the Rings_. Maybe both. Perhaps you've begun the _Silmarillion_, but found it hard to get through the forest of "eye-splitting Celtic names," to borrow the words of one critic. Or maybe you've only made it through the first few chapters of _The Lord of the Rings_ and put it down wondering what all the fuss is about. That was my situation, years ago.

I first picked up The _Lord of the Rings_ at the age of ten or eleven, and found it to be a merciless slog, devoid of the humor that made _The Hobbit_ so delightful. But all the cool kids were talking about it—I couldn't just *not* read it. So I decided to cheat: I flipped through to the back of the book, to see how it ended.

What confronted me was not a climactic duel between Frodo and Sauron, but a hundred-odd pages worth of Appendices, filled with histories and genealogies and calendars, and above all *languages*. The Appendices gave me the sense that Tolkien's real goal with _The Lord of the Rings_ was not to tell the story of Frodo or Sauron but *to create the world in which those stories could be told*. I began reading Tolkien with a new purpose: to discover Middle-earth. My reward was immeasurable.

What I discovered was what many others have discovered: Tolkien invented languages. Marvelous, intricate, beautiful languages. A New York Times columnist once asked Tolkien about the origins of his work. Tolkien replied "I am a philologist, [i.e. a historical linguist] and all my work is philological". He later clarified in a letter to his publisher,

> the remark about <q>philology</q> was intended to allude to what I think is a primary <q>fact</q> about my work, that it is all of a piece, and <em>fundamentally linguistic</em> in inspiration. [. . .] The invention of languages is the foundation. The <q>stories</q> were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in <q>Elvish</q>.

In light of such strong statements, it should be clear that we can only hope to understand Tolkien's work if we share, or at least acknowledge, his passion for language.

However, Tolkien never shared this passion readily. He was always rather shy and self-deprecating about his language-creation habit, calling it a "secret vice" and a "mad hobby". He never published any grammars or vocabularies of the Elvish languages—perhaps because he thought no one would buy them, but also because he loved the total creative freedom that he had as a language inventor. Publishing information about Elvish would have forced him to get the languages into a "final" form, and that was something he could never bring himself to do. For Tolkien, the fun of invented languages was in the process of creation, not in using the finished product. He invented many more words than he ever used in Elvish poetry or prose.

Of course, we non-Tolkien people can't experience the joy of *creating* the Elvish languages. But we can *discover* them, and since our eyes are, as it were, newly woken to Middle-earth, our experience will be fresher and keener than even the experience of a creator.

## Tolkien's Languages

Tolkien imagined many different languages being spoken in Arda, but he really developed only two of them: the Elvish tongues **Quenya** and **Sindarin**. Quenya and Sindarin are sibling languages—Tolkien imagined that they developed from a common ancestor, much as French and Spanish both developed from Latin. He even worked out the evolution of each language in some detail. Since the languages are related we can use what we know about Quenya to make educated guesses about the grammar and vocabulary of Sindarin, and vice versa.

Tolkien's real-world inspiration for Quenya were Finnish and Latin. Quenya uses lots of L's and rolled R's, and most words end in a vowel: ***Ai laurië lantar lassi súrinen / Yéni únótimë ve rámar aldaron / Yéni ve lintë yuldar avánier***

Sindarin was inspired by Welsh. Most words end in a consonant, and the hard consonants **T**, **P**, and **K** favored by Quenya were often "softened" to **D**, **B**, and **G** during the fictional development of Sindarin. Sindarin also has the sound **TH**, which was replaced by **S** in Quenya.

***Ennyn Durin Aran Moria: Pedo mellon a minno. Im Narvi hain echant. Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thîw hin.***

This book is about Sindarin—though I refer frequently to Quenya words and constructions that help shed light on Sindarin.

In Middle-earth the role of Sindarin was similar to that of Mandarin in modern China. The standard form, Classical Sindarin, was a learned or courtly language among both Elves and Men, though there were also many dialects that were _mutually intelligible_: speakers of one dialect could generally understand the other dialects. While Sindarin was widely used, it was not the native language of many Elves. Local languages, distantly related to Sindarin, were more common mother-tongues.

Tolkien based the sound and general aesthetic of Sindarin on Welsh—a language he encountered in childhood and quickly fell in love with. For a long time—the 1930s and early 40s—Tolkien called his Welsh-flavored language Noldorin. Shortly before _The Lord of the Rings_ was published, Tolkien made a sweeping revision to Noldorin, changing some of its sounds and its place within Middle-earth's history—he now imagined it being spoken by a different group of Elves, the _Sindar_, so it was renamed _Sindarin_.

The revision from Noldorin to Sindarin is a major event for modern scholars of Elvish. A lot of our "Sindarin" vocabulary is actually only documented during the Noldorin phase! We can generally assume that Noldorin words are valid in Sindarin, often with some minor changes to certain sounds, but of course there are exceptions.

## Why This Book?

Other books (and many websites) that claim to teach Elvish exist. Why start with this book?

Most of the other resources are structured as **language courses**: they start out with some basic phrases and vocabulary, and gradually build up from there, giving examples of sentences and dialogue to illustrate the points. By the end of the course, you have not only an understanding of the grammar, but a feel for how to use the language in your own compositions.

Now, Tolkien himself never published descriptions of his languages, and the few snippets of Elvish poetry and prose in his writings hardly cover all the details of grammar. So where do these courses get their information?

We can get a long way toward a speakable language by making some *educated guesses*. By analyzing the patterns in the language samples we *do* have, we can fill the gaps in the grammar, smooth over the inconsistencies, and add new vocabulary. David Salo, who wrote the Elvish dialogue and lyrics for the Peter Jackson movies, is perhaps the foremost expert on this process. His book, _A Gateway to Sindarin_, takes a step toward a "finished" Elvish language by describing Sindarin almost as if it were a real language of our own Earth. We'd like to imagine that the result is close to what Tolkien himself might have published if he'd collected all his writings into a Sindarin grammar.

The problem is, Tolkien never had plans to publish a Sindarin grammar. He never intended his languages to be "finished" or spoken by anyone except the characters in his books. He saw the languages as a form of artistic expression. Making the languages usable was unrelated to that goal. And that means that there is never going to be a canonical, authentically Tolkien-made language that can also be spoken fluently.

So if we want to "learn Tolkien's Elvish", we're left with a dilemma. If we work only from the Tolkien-made examples, we don't have enough material to make a usable language. We've "learned Tolkien" but we haven't "learned Elvish". If we try to fill in the gaps, we end up with a language that is not genuine Tolkien—that is in fact genuinely un-Tolkienian in purpose. We've "learned Elvish" but disregarded Tolkien.

You might be wondering at this point which path you'd rather take. The purpose of this book is to make it so that you don't have to decide once and for all. You can learn about Tolkien's writings, or about how we might use them to "complete" Sindarin, as you like. This book describes both possibilities.

I've divided this book into three major sections: _Roots_, _Branches_, and _Scattered Seeds_.

_Roots_ lays a solid foundation for the study of Sindarin. It describes the parts of the language about which we're relatively certain: features that are evidenced all over Tolkien's writings and remained consistent throughout his life.

_Branches_ describes the areas of the language where Tolkien just couldn't make up his mind. Often, we know Tolkien considered multiple options for a particular piece of the grammar, but it's not clear which one he settled on or if he even did settle on anything. In this case, I think it's best to describe the alternatives and their ramifications.

_Scattered Seeds_ is about the cases where we have a single, isolated example of a word. It also covers various extensions that people have made to create a more usable form of Sindarin. David Salo's movie-Sindarin is covered here.

Samples in published works are treated as authoritative, even if there are no corroborating examples. In these cases, the evidence is open to interpretation but the fact that it *is* evidence, representing Tolkien's long-term intentions, is not in doubt.

In unpublished works, the path is a little less certain. I generally don't regard isolated examples from Tolkien's private notes as being anything more than a suggestion of what he was thinking at one moment in time. After all, he never intended these notes for publication, and his creative process involved a lot of experimentation. However, if multiple examples exist from different years or conceptual phases, that's a strong indication of a stable language feature. Where multiple data points exist and form a pattern, I treat that as authoritative evidence.

Somewhere in between is evidence from Tolkien's letters. Here we find language features that Tolkien had worked out enough to tell someone else about, but maybe would not have published to the world at large. I treat evidence from the letters as authoritative.

This book is designed to complement the existing online resources on Sindarin, not to replace them. That's why I haven't included a dictionary or a list of Sindarin texts—you can readily find these online. That being said, the online resources vary widely in quality, so I've posted a list of trusted links at the following URL:

# <a name="roots">Roots</a>

# <a name="pronunciation">Pronunciation</a>

This page is intended to be a *complete* guide to the sounds of Sindarin. Because of that, it's *super long*, and some of what's here may not seem relevant until you've explored the language further. If you get bogged down in the details, there's also a [quick guide](./pronunciation-quick.html) that just covers the basics.

## Vowels

English-speakers tend to think of there being *five vowels*: A, E, I, O, and U. However, these are just the vowel *letters*. English has way more than five vowel *sounds*. Just look at this list:

<table class="center-block">
<tr>
<td>Pete</td><td>pit</td><td>pate</td><td>pet</td><td>pat</td><td>pike</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>poot</td><td>put</td><td>pout</td><td>putt</td><td>pot</td><td>poke</td>
</tr>
</table>

Sindarin doesn't have English's huge variety of sounds. In Sindarin, the five main vowels [.s A], [.s E], [.s I], [.s O], and [.s U] are always pronounced the same way.

### The Big Five

Pronounce Sindarin [.s A], [.s E], [.s I], [.s O], [.s U] as "ah", "eh", "ee", "oh", "oo". Tolkien was aiming for familiarity here: Spanish, Italian, and many other languages have similar vowel systems.

Even English sometimes uses the five vowels with their Sindarin pronunciations:

- [.s A]: &ldquo;f[.hi a]ther&rdquo;
- [.s E]: &ldquo;w[.hi e]ll&rdquo;
- [.s I]: &ldquo;mach[.hi i]ne&rdquo;
- [.s O]: &ldquo;f[.hi o]r&rdquo;
- [.s U]: &ldquo;br[.hi u]te&rdquo;

With those examples in mind, try pronouncing these words:

- [.s ungol] "spider"
- [.s lembas] "waybread"
- [.s Legolas] "Greenleaf"
- [.s Osgiliath] "Citadel of the Stars"

[^vowels]: Tolkien's own pronunciation guide, in Appendix E, gives "father", "were", "machine", "for", and "brute" as the exemplars. "Were" is problematic for American speakers because the R-sound completely replaces the vowel, so I've used "well" instead.

### The Sixth Vowel: Y

In addition to the five main vowels, Sindarin has a sixth vowel [.s Y] with no equivalent in English. It's the sound of _u_ in French _lune_, or _ü_ in German _über_. To pronounce it, say "ee" but with your lips rounded as if saying "oo".

If those instructions sound nonsensical, it's because "ee" usually stretches your lips into a smile, basically the opposite of "oo". (That's why people say "cheese" for photos!) However, the other important feature of "ee" is that your mouth is nearly closed when saying it, leaving only a small air gap above your tongue. So combine that "closeness" with lip-rounding and you have the Sindarin [.s Y] sound.

### Accents and Vowel Length

An acute accent ([.s á é í ó ú]) indicates that the vowel is held for a slightly longer duration. So in a word like [.s míriel] "sparkling like jewels", the first syllable [.s mí] is held about twice as long as the second syllable [.s ri].

A circumflex ([.s â ê î ô û]) also indicates a long vowel, but is mostly used in words of one syllable. This may just be an aesthetic whim of Tolkien's, though he justified it by saying that vowels with the circumflex should be held _even longer_. However, the Elvish writing systems only distinguish two vowel lengths, long and short, so the Elves must not have considered this detail very important.

### Diphthongs

A diphthong (pronounced [.pron DIFF-thong], from the Greek for "two sounds") is a combination of two vowel sounds that blur together into a single syllable. Diphthongs appear frequently in English, like the "ou" in "house" that starts with an "ah" sound and ends with an "oo" sound. Sindarin has a similar diphthong, spelled [.s au].

Here is the complete list of Sindarin diphthongs:

* [.s AI]: as in &ldquo;[.hi ai]sle&rdquo;
* [.s AE]: no English equivalent. [.s AE] is a glide from an [.s A] into an [.s E]. The resulting sound should be similar to [.s AI]; Tolkien even suggested pronouncing [.s AE] the same as [.s AI] if you're not picky. Or you could aim for a Mirkwood accent and pronounce it like [.s E]: compare Mirkwood [.s Legolas] to Classical Sindarin [.s Laegolas].
* [.s AU] or [.s AW]: like "ou" in &ldquo;h[.hi ou]se&rdquo;. [.s AU] and [.s AW] are simply variant spellings of the same sound.
* [.s EI]: as in &ldquo;w[.hi ei]gh&rdquo;
* [.s OE]: like "oy" in &ldquo;b[.hi oy]&rdquo;, but ending in an "eh" sound.
* [.s UI]: as in "ruin", but ending in a tense "ee" sound rather than the "ih" sound. Tolkien noted that this was a "long diphthong" and scanned as two syllables in poetry: hence [.s Fanuilos, le linnathon] in the Hymn to Elbereth, where the meter requires eight syllables per line.

## Consonants

### Voiced and Voiceless Sounds

Sindarin has several pairs of consonant sounds that differ by being _voiced_ or _voiceless_—_voice_ being a linguistics term meaning vibration of the vocal cords. Don't be worried by the terminology, though. If you can speak English, you're already pronouncing voiced and voiceless sounds all the time. You can feel the buzzing of your vocal cords if you put your hand on your throat and say "ZZZ". If you then turn the Z into an S, the buzzing stops. Voiced sounds like Z or V have a buzzing or humming quality, while their voiceless counterparts S and F sound more like a hiss or whisper. (In fact, voicelessness is *the* defining feature of whispering. Try whispering *loudly*; your speech may be audible but you'll be pronouncing all the sounds voicelessly.

Voiced/voiceless pairs in English include:

- Voiced V, voiceless F: *veil* vs. *fail*
- Voiced Z, voiceless S: *zoo* vs. *sue*
- Voiced J, voiceless CH: *gin* vs. *chin*
- Voiced D, voiceless T: *deal* vs. *teal*
- Voiced G, voiceless K: *got* vs. *caught*
- Voiced B, voiceless P: *bun* vs. *pun*

Sindarin has many of the same pairs as English, but some won't be familiar:

- Voiced [.s R], voiceless [.s RH]
- Voiced [.s L], voiceless [.s LH]
- Voiced [.s W], voiceless [.s HW]

I'll describe all of these in the giant list of consonants below.

### The Consonants of Sindarin

- [.s B]: as in English.
- [.s C]: always hard, as in "cat". [.s Celeborn] is pronounced _Keleborn_, not _Seleborn_.
- [.s CH]: as in Scottish _loch_ or German _Bach_. If you have a hard time replicating this sound, you could pronounce it like H or K, as the Gondorians did. In the Gondor dialect the place-name _Rochann_ was pronounnced as if the _ch_ were an _h_—hence the spelling _Rohan_ in _LotR_.
- [.s D]: as in English, except in the combination [.s DH], below.
- [.s DH]: like the _th_ in _weather_. This is a voiced sound; contrast with voiceless [.s TH]. If you have trouble keeping the [.s DH]/[.s TH] distinction straight, remember that [.s DH] is like Z pronounced with an exaggerated lisp.
- [.s F]: usually pronounced as in English, but at the end of a word it sounds like [.s V] (think English "of"). The word [.s nef] "on this side of" is pronounced _nev_ as in English "never". This quirk of spelling probably hearkens back to Tolkien's fondness for Welsh, where _f_ has a V-sound.
- [.s H]: as in English—though it often combines with other letters: see [.s CH], [.s DH], [.s HW], [.s LH], [.s RH], [.s TH].
- [.s HW]: the _wh_ sound of "whale", in varieties of English that pronounce it differently from "wail". This is a voiceless version of [.s W].
- [.s I]: is normally a vowel but moonlights as a consonant. When it appears before another vowel at the beginning of a word, it sounds like the Y in "yes". So [.s ionnath] "sons" and [.s Ioreth] "Old Woman" begin with a "yo" sound.
- [.s M]: as in English.
- [.s P]: as in English.
- [.s PH]: as in _photograph_. In the middle of a word, it represents a lengthened F-sound: a word like _ephel_ "outer fence" would be pronounced _ef-fel_.
- [.s N]: as in English.
- [.s NG] at the end of a word is the sound heard in "sing". Elsewhere it represents the same sound plus a hard G, as in "finger".
- [.s G]: is always hard, as in "get". Sindarin doesn't have the J-sound heard in "gem".
- [.s L]: always as in "let", with the tip of the tongue touching or just behind the upper teeth. In English, L is sometimes pronounced with the tongue bunched up in the back of the mouth, as in "cold", but this variant of L does not exist in Sindarin.
- [.s LH]: the sound of _LL_ in Welsh _Llewellyn_—a peculiar sound, if you've not heard it before. To pronounce it, put your tongue in a position to say L, and blow gently. The resulting sound should be somewhere between _th_ and _sl_ (in fact, the LH sound developed from earlier SL, found in Old Sindarin).
- [.s R]: trilled, as in Spanish. In Appendix E, Tolkien notes that the back-of-the-throat R-sound heard in French or German was not used by the Elves.
- [.s RH]: a Sindarin R-sound pronounced voicelessly. If you can pronounce R and HW, you're halfway to pronouncing RH. Just pronounce R while exhaling breathily as for HW.
- [.s S]: never sounds like Z, as it often does in English at the end of a word. It is always pronounced as in "sets".
- [.s T]: as in English.
- [.s TH]: the sound of _th_ in _thin_. This is a voiceless sound, contrasting with voiced [.s DH].
- [.s V]: as in English.
- [.s W]: as in English. [.s W] can occur at the end of a word in Sindarin, where it is pronounced as a very short [.s U] sound: [.s têw] "letter".

### Splitting Up Letter Combinations

The combinations [.s DH], [.s LH], [.s RH], [.s TH] sometimes represent a sequence of two distinct sounds, e.g. T+H. For example, [.s Panthael] ("Fullwise", a name given to Sam Gamgee by Aragorn), is a compound [.s pant+hael], so the [.s t] and [.s h] represent distinct sounds. Similarly, [.s Edhelharn] "Elfstone", is a compound [.s edhel+harn].

How do you know when to pronounce the letter-sequence "th" as T+H, and when to pronounce it as a single sound? The answer, unfortunately, is that you just have to recognize the rare cases where "th" represents T+H.

It's worth noting that the sounds [.s LH] and [.s RH] cannot occur in the middle of a word, so if you see a word like [.s Edhelharn] or [.s Perhael] "Halfwise", you know that the [.s H] should be a separate sound.

Tengwar writing doesn't have this ambiguity, because the sounds [.s DH], [.s LH], [.s RH], [.s TH] each have their own symbol. So recognizing letter combinations that should be split up isn't just relevant for pronunciation—you need to know this to write in tengwar, as well!

## Stress

Sindarin, like English, puts emphasis or _stress_ on one syllable of multi-syllable words. In English, stress can alter the meaning of a word, as in the following:

> Sam received a **present** from Galadriel.
> Galadriel will **present** the hobbits with lembas.

With the first syllable stressed, &ldquo;[.hi pre]sent&rdquo; is a noun. Stress the second syllable, &ldquo;pre[.hi sent]&rdquo;, and it becomes a verb.

In Sindarin, the stress of a word can't change its meaning, but it's vital to learn how words are stressed in order to write poetry. If you don't pronounce words with the right stress, you'll just sound weird.

Fortunately, Sindarin stress is predicatable from the shape of the word, so you don't have to memorize where the stress falls for each word individually. This section describes how to figure out which syllable is stressed.

### Syllables

Before you can place the stress in a word, you have to break it down into syllables. The syllables or beats of a word are determined by the vowels. Each syllable has exactly one vowel or diphthong at its core—no more, no less. So [.s Elbereth Gilthoniel] breaks down as [.s El&middot;be&middot;reth Gil&middot;tho&middot;ni&middot;el]. [.s Thranduil] has only two syllables, [.s Thran&middot;duil], because [.s ui] is a diphthong.

### Stress in Two-Syllable Words

Tolkien states in Appendix E that "[i]n words of two syllables, [the stress] falls in practically all cases on the first syllable". However, he neglects to list any Sindarin exceptions to this rule, so for our purposes, two-syllable Sindarin words are *always* stressed on the first syllable. Thus we have [.s <span class="hi">Per</span>&middot;hael] "Samwise", [.s <span class="hi">El</span>&middot;rond].

### Stress in Longer Words

The general rule for longer words is to stress the third-to-last syllable: [.s <span class="hi">El</span>&middot;be&middot;reth], [.s Gil&middot;<span class="hi">tho</span>&middot;ni&middot;el], [.s <span class="hi">Le</span>&middot;go&middot;las]

However, the second-to-last syllable gets the stress if its vowel is:

- long (accented), as [.s í] in [.s Celeb<span class="hi">rí</span>an] ("Silver-queen", Arwen's mother)
- a diphthong, as [.s ae] in [.s Hi<span class="hi">thaeg</span>lir] ("the Misty Mountains")
- or followed by multiple consonants: [.s Cele<span class="hi">brim</span>bor] ("Silver-fist")

Note that in the last case, it's consonant *sounds* and not letters that are important. [.s TH], [.s DH], etc. are single sounds even though they're represented by two letters, so the [.s th] in [.s <span class="hi">Nim</span>brethil] doesn't cause the stress to move.

### Possible Exceptions to the Stress Rule

There are some Sindarin names that don't seem to follow the stress rules in Appendix E, among them [.s Imladris] (Rivendell) and [.s Nargothrond]. These "should" be stressed [.s Im<span class="hi">lad</span>ris], [.s Nar<span class="hi">goth</span>rond], because the second-to-last syllable of each is followed by two consonants. However, we can observe that both are stressed on the first syllable in poetry. I've written at length about this issue [here](../stress-in-sindarin.html).
