# _Mae govannen!_

If you've picked up this book, I assume I don't need to introduce you to J.R.R. Tolkien. Maybe you've read _The Hobbit_ or _The Lord of the Rings_. Maybe both. Perhaps you've even delved into the _Silmarillion_ or the _History of Middle-earth_ series... or maybe you've only read the first few chapters of _The Lord of the Rings_ and put it down wondering what all the hype is about. That was my situation, years ago.

I first picked up The _Lord of the Rings_ at the age of ten or eleven, and found it to be a merciless slog, devoid of the humor that made _The Hobbit_ so delightful. But all the cool kids were talking about it—I couldn't just *not* read it. So I decided to cheat: I flipped through to the back of the book, to see how it ended.

What confronted me was not a climactic duel between Frodo and Sauron, but a hundred-odd pages worth of Appendices, filled with histories and genealogies and calendars, and above all *languages*. The Appendices gave me the sense that Tolkien's real goal with _The Lord of the Rings_ was not to tell the story of Frodo or Sauron but *to create the world in which those stories could be told*. I began reading Tolkien with a new purpose: to discover Middle-earth. My reward was immeasurable.

What I discovered was what many others have discovered: Tolkien invented languages. Marvelous, intricate, beautiful languages. The Elvish greeting _Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo_ isn't just pretty non&shy;sense—&shy;Tolkien worked out the grammar and history of the language (Quenya) in incredible detail. Despite appearing mostly in the Appendices, the languages were not an afterthought: they predated and in fact inspired the invention of Middle-earth. As Tolkien wrote in a letter to his publisher,

> The invention of languages is the foundation. The <q>stories</q> were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in <q>Elvish</q>.[.cite letters 221]

In light of such strong statements, it's clear that to understand Tolkien's work we need to share, or at least acknowledge, his passion for language.

However, Tolkien never shared this passion readily. He was always rather shy and self-deprecating about his language-creation habit, calling it a "secret vice" and a "mad hobby"[.cite letters 8]. He never sought to publish an Elvish grammar or dictionary—perhaps because he thought no one would be interested, but also because he loved the total creative freedom he had as a language inventor. Publishing information about Elvish would have forced him to get the languages into a "final" form and then stop working on them, and that was something he could never bring himself to do. For Tolkien, the fun of invented languages was in creating and re-creating, not in using a "finished" product.

Of course, we non-Tolkien people can't experience the joy of *creating* the Elvish languages. But we can *discover* them, and since our eyes are newly opened to Middle-earth, our experience will be fresher and keener than even the experience of a creator.

## Tolkien's Languages

Tolkien imagined many different languages being spoken in Arda[.note The name of Tolkien's fictional world, as a whole. _Middle-earth_ is properly the name of only one continent in that world.], but he really developed only two of them: the Elvish tongues **Quenya** and **Sindarin**. Quenya and Sindarin are sibling languages—they developed from a common ancestor, **Eldarin**, much as French and Spanish both developed from Latin. Tolkien worked out the evolution of each language in some detail, and this historical consistency is a huge help when trying to decipher the languages. Since Quenya and Sindarin are related we can use what we know about one to make educated guesses about the grammar and vocabulary of the other.

The Elvish languages are not designed to mirror any particular real-world languages, but Tolkien drew inspiration from the real languages he knew and loved. Quenya's abundant <em>L</em>s, rolled <em>R</em>s, and vowels echo Finnish and Latin:

> _Ai! laurië lantar lassi súrinen,_
> _Yéni únótimë ve rámar aldaron!_
> _Yéni ve lintë yuldar avánier_
> _mi oromardi lisse-miruvóreva [. . .]_[.note _The Fellowship of the Ring_, p. 394]

Sindarin, by contrast, was inspired by Tolkien's first love, Welsh. Most words end in a consonant, and the hard consonants **T**, **P**, and **K** favored by Quenya were often "softened" to **D**, **B**, and **G**. Sindarin also has the sound **TH**, which was replaced by **S** in Quenya.

> _A Elbereth Gilthoniel,_
> _silivren penna míriel_
> _o menel aglar elenath!_
> _Na-chaered palan-díriel_
> _o galadhremmin ennorath,_
> _Fanuilos, le linnathon,_
> _nef aear, sí nef aearon!_[.note _The Fellowship of the Ring_, p. 250]

This book is about Sindarin—though I refer frequently to Quenya words and constructions that help shed light on Sindarin.

## Learning Tolkien's Languages

Beginner-friendly guides to Elvish are often structured as language courses: they start out with some basic phrases and vocabulary, building up from there with examples of sentences and dialogue. By the end of the course, you have an understanding of the grammar and a feel for how to use the language in your own compositions.

The problem is, Tolkien never planned to make his languages usable—he was more interested in just making up words and imagining how they changed over time. His linguistic notes reflect this: they're full of beautiful words and historical details, but short on practical advice to language-learners.

This lack of practical source material means that we'll never be fluent in Sindarin—not as long as we stick to Tolkien canon. We can try to make Sindarin into a fully-usable language, but that requires creating new words and grammar that Tolkien never imagined and likely would not have approved of.

So if we want to "learn Tolkien's Elvish", we're left with a dilemma. If we work only from Tolkien's examples, we don't have enough material to make a usable language. We've "learned Tolkien" but we haven't "learned Elvish". If we try to fill in the gaps, we end up with a non-canon language. We've "learned Elvish" but disregarded Tolkien.

You might be wondering at this point which path you'd rather take. The purpose of this book is to make it so that you don't have to decide once and for all. You can learn about Tolkien's writings, or about how we might "complete" Sindarin, as you like. I describe both possibilities. The book is divided into sections to make it clear where one type of investigation ends and the next begins.

The first section, **Roots**, describes the hard core of Tolkien's Sindarin—the parts of the language about which we're relatively certain, and which survived many, many cycles of Tolkien's ceaseless revision. Examples from _The Lord of the Rings_ provide most of the data, though I also refer to Tolkien's posthumously-published notes when they show that some feature of the language stayed constant throughout his life. Reading just this section will give you a solid understanding of the Sin&shy;darin in _LotR_. You'll be able to pronounce the words, write in _tengwar_, and put together Sindarin phrases of your own.

The second section, **Branches**, is about the tough decisions that Tolkien made (or avoided) when working out the grammar of Sindarin —there are many parts of the language where he just couldn't make up his mind. Often, we know that he considered multiple options for a particular piece of the grammar, but it's not clear which one he settled on or if he even did settle on anything. In such cases, I think it's best to describe the alternatives and their ramifications.

The final section, **Scattered Leaves**, covers the various attempts that have been made to "complete" Sindarin. You'll need to read this section to understand the Sindarin dialogue in the _Lord of the Rings_ movies, since the language used there is largely a post-Tolkien invent&shy;ion.

## Online Resources

This book is designed to complement the existing online resources for learning Sindarin, not to replace them. That's why I haven't included a dictionary or a list of Sindarin texts—you can easily find these on the web. That being said, the online resources vary widely in quality, so I've posted a list of trusted links at **menegroth.github.io/links.html**

## Feedback

This book is a work in progress—the current version is in fact an alpha release, intentionally left incomplete in the interest of getting feedback on the project before I sink too much time into it. If you read what I've written so far and want more, please email me! Criticism is also very welcome, especially if you find actual mistakes (which I'm sure I've made), or you find a particular section hard to understand.

# <a name="pronunciation">Pronunciation</a>

It's hard to learn pronunciation from a book—an audio recording is worth a thousand words of print. This chapter will give you the basics, but you should also check out the online resources. These include recordings of Tolkien pronouncing Sindarin words from _The Lord of the Rings_—naturally the ultimate source for learning to say them correctly yourself. You can find a list of links at

menegroth.github.io/links.html.

## Standard Fantasy Phonology

Tolkien's languages have many imitators in fantasy literature, probably because they balance nicely between familiar and exotic. If you pronounce Sindarin like Latin or Greek you won't be far off.

It's nice that Sindarin's spelling is _phonetic_, so each sound has only one possible spelling, and each letter (or letter combination) almost always represents the same sound. Still, Tolkien uses some sounds and spellings that differ enough from English to deserve mention.

### Consonants

- [.s C] and [.s G] are always hard, as in _cat_ and _get_. [.s Celeborn] is pronounced "Keleborn".
- [.s CH] is the sound in German _Bach_. If this sound gives you trouble, you could pronounce it [.s H] or [.s K], as the Gondorians did. In the Gondor dialect the place-name [.s Rochann] was pronounced [.s Rohan]—hence the spelling used in _LotR_.
- [.s R] is tapped or trilled, as in Spanish.
- [.s F] is usually pronounced as in English, but at the end of a word it sounds like [.s V] (think English "of"). The word [.s nef] "on this side of" is pronounced _nev_ as in _never_. This quirk of spelling probably hearkens back to Tolkien's fondness for Welsh, where _f_ has a V-sound.
- [.s TH] and [.s DH] are the sounds of _thin_ and _this_, respectively. The difference is that when you say _this_ your vocal cords are vibrating—put a finger on your throat and you can feel the difference.
- [.s LH] and [.s RH] are like [.s L] and [.s R] pronounced voicelessly—that is, with no vocal cord vibration. These sounds are lifted straight from Welsh, where they're spelled _LL_ and _RH_: _Llewellyn_, _Rhiannon_.
- [.s HW] is similarly a voiceless version of [.s W]. This is the WH-sound in _whale_, in varieties of English that pronounce it differently from _wail_.
- [.s S] is *always* voiceless—it never has a Z-sound, even at the end of a word. The last syllable of [.s Fanuilos] "Everwhite" sounds like _loss_.
- [.s W] by itself is pronounced as in English—but unlike in English it can appear at the end of a word, where it has a very short "oo" sound: [.s têw] "letter".
- [.s I] is normally a vowel but moonlights as a consonant. When it appears before another vowel at the beginning of a word, it sounds like the Y in _yes_. So [.s ionnath] "sons" and [.s Ioreth] "Old Woman" begin with a _yo_ sound.
- [.s NG], between vowels, is pronounced with a hard [.s G] as in _finger_. At the end or beginning of a word, it's pronounced as in _ring_.

(Yes, you read that right: [.s NG] can _begin_ a word in Sindarin, as in [.s i&nbsp;ngaurhoth] "the werewolf-horde". This can be hard for English-speakers, but fortunately word-initial [.s NG] almost always follows a vowel. If you say _ing aurhoth_ probably no one will notice.)

### Vowels

The vowel letters A, E, I, O, and U correspond one-to-one with the vowel sounds "ah", "eh", "ee", "oh", "oo". Tolkien was aiming for familiarity here: Spanish, Italian, and many other languages have similar vowel systems.

Even English, for all its crazy spelling, sometimes uses the five vowels with their Sindarin pronunciations:

- [.s A]: &ldquo;f[.hi a]ther&rdquo;
- [.s E]: &ldquo;w[.hi e]ll&rdquo;
- [.s I]: &ldquo;mach[.hi i]ne&rdquo;
- [.s O]: &ldquo;f[.hi o]r&rdquo;
- [.s U]: &ldquo;br[.hi u]te&rdquo;

With those examples in mind, try pronouncing these words:

- [.s ungol] "spider"
- [.s lembas] "waybread"
- [.s Legolas] "Greenleaf"
- [.s Osgiliath] "Citadel of the Stars"

In addition to the five main vowels, Sindarin has a sixth vowel [.s Y] with no equivalent in English. It's the sound of _u_ in French _lune_, or _ü_ in German _über_. To pronounce it, say "ee" but with your lips rounded as if saying "oo".

If those instructions sound nonsensical, it's because "ee" usually stretches your lips into a smile, basically the opposite of "oo". (That's why people say "cheese" for photos!) However, the other important feature of "ee" is that your mouth is nearly closed when saying it, leaving only a small air gap above your tongue. So combine that "closeness" with lip-rounding and you have the Sindarin [.s Y] sound.

In Gondor, [.s Y] was often pronounced the same as [.s I]—the Gondorians found this sound as troublesome as we do.

### Accents and Vowel Length

An acute accent ([.s á é í ó ú ý]) indicates that the vowel is held for a slightly longer duration. So in a word like [.s míriel] "sparkling like jewels", the first syllable [.s mí] is held about twice as long as the second syllable [.s ri].

A circumflex ([.s â ê î ô û ŷ]) also indicates a long vowel, but is mostly used in words of one syllable. This may just be an aesthetic whim of Tolkien's, though he justified it by saying that vowels with the circumflex should be held _even longer_. However, the Elvish writing systems only distinguish two vowel lengths, long and short, so the Elves must not have considered this detail very important.

### Diphthongs

A diphthong (pronounced [.pron DIFF-thong], from the Greek for "two sounds") is a combination of two vowel sounds that blur together into a single syllable. Diphthongs appear frequently in English, like the "ou" in "house" that starts with an "ah" sound and ends with an "oo" sound. Sindarin has a similar diphthong, spelled [.s au].

Here is the complete list of Sindarin diphthongs:

* [.s AI]: as in &ldquo;[.hi ai]sle&rdquo;
* [.s AE]: no English equivalent. [.s AE] is a glide from an [.s A] into an [.s E]. The resulting sound should be similar to [.s AI]; Tolkien even suggested pronouncing [.s AE] the same as [.s AI] if you're not picky. Or you could aim for a Mirkwood accent and pronounce it like [.s E]: compare Mirkwood [.s Legolas] to Classical Sindarin [.s Laegolas].
* [.s AU] or [.s AW]: like "ou" in &ldquo;h[.hi ou]se&rdquo;. [.s AU] and [.s AW] are simply variant spellings of the same sound.
* [.s EI]: as in &ldquo;w[.hi ei]gh&rdquo;
* [.s OE]: like "oy" in &ldquo;b[.hi oy]&rdquo;, but ending in an "eh" sound.
* [.s UI]: as in "ruin", but ending in a tense "ee" sound rather than the "ih" sound. Tolkien noted that this was a "long diphthong" and scanned as two syllables in poetry: hence [.s Fanuilos, le linnathon] in the Hymn to Elbereth, where the meter requires eight syllables per line.

## <a name="splitting-up-letter-combinations">Spelling Ambiguities</a>

The modern English alphabet simply doesn't have enough letters to represent Sindarin unambiguously. In compound words especially, confusion can arise.

The combinations [.s DH], [.s LH], [.s RH], [.s TH] sometimes represent a sequence of two distinct sounds, e.g. [.s T]+[.s H]. For example, [.s Panthael] ("Fullwise", a name given to Sam Gamgee by Aragorn), is a compound [.s pant+hael], so the [.s t] and [.s h] are pronounced separately, as in _anthill_, not as in _anthem_. Similarly, [.s Edhelharn] "Elfstone", is a compound [.s edhel+harn].

So how do you know when to pronounce the letter-sequence "th" as [.s T]+[.s H], and when to pronounce it as a single sound? The answer, unfortunately, is that you just have to memorize the (rare) cases where "th" represents [.s T]+[.s H].

It's worth noting that the sounds [.s LH] and [.s RH] can't occur in the middle of a word, so if you see a word like [.s Edhelharn] or [.s Perhael] "Halfwise", you know that the [.s H] should be a separate sound.

The Elvish writing system _tengwar_ doesn't have this ambiguity, because the sounds [.s DH], [.s LH], [.s RH], [.s TH] each have their own symbol. So recognizing letter combinations that should be split up isn't just relevant for pronunciation—you need to know this to write in tengwar, as well!

## Stress

Sindarin, like English, puts emphasis or _stress_ on one syllable of multi-syllable words. In English, stress can alter the meaning of a word, as in the following:

> Sam received a **present** from Galadriel.
> We have to **present** our project to the class.

With the first syllable stressed, &ldquo;[.hi pre]sent&rdquo; is a noun. Stress the second syllable, &ldquo;pre[.hi sent]&rdquo;, and it becomes a verb.

In Sindarin, the stress of a word can't change its meaning, but it's vital to learn how words are stressed in order to write poetry. If you pronounce words with the wrong stress, you'll just sound weird.

Fortunately, Sindarin stress is predicatable from the shape of the word, so you don't have to memorize where the stress falls for each word individually. This section describes how to figure out which syllable is stressed.

### Syllables

Before you can place the stress in a word, you have to break it down into syllables. Many people find this difficult at first, but there's a trick to it: look at the vowels.

Each syllable has exactly one vowel or diphthong at its core—no more, no less. So [.s Elbereth Gilthoniel] breaks down as [.s El&middot;be&middot;reth Gil&middot;tho&middot;ni&middot;el]. [.s Thranduil] has only two syllables, [.s Thran&middot;duil], because [.s ui] is a diphthong.

### Stress in Two-Syllable Words

Tolkien states in Appendix E that "[i]n words of two syllables, [the stress] falls in practically all cases on the first syllable". Thus we have [.s <span class="hi">Per</span>&middot;hael] "Samwise", [.s <span class="hi">El</span>&middot;rond].

### Stress in Longer Words

The general rule for longer words is to stress the third-to-last syllable: [.s <span class="hi">El</span>&middot;be&middot;reth], [.s Gil&middot;<span class="hi">tho</span>&middot;ni&middot;el], [.s <span class="hi">Le</span>&middot;go&middot;las]

However, the second-to-last syllable gets the stress if its vowel is:

- long (accented), as [.s í] in [.s Celeb<span class="hi">rí</span>an] ("Silver-queen", Arwen's mother)
- a diphthong, as [.s ae] in [.s Hi<span class="hi">thaeg</span>lir] ("the Misty Mountains")
- or followed by multiple consonants: [.s Cele<span class="hi">brim</span>bor] ("Silver-fist")

Note that in the last case it's consonant *sounds*, not letters, that are important. [.s TH], [.s DH], etc. are single sounds even though they're represented by two letters, so the [.s th] in [.s <span class="hi">Nim</span>brethil] doesn't cause the stress to move.

### Possible Exceptions to the Stress Rule

There are some Sindarin names that don't seem to follow the stress rules in Appendix E, among them [.s Imladris] (Rivendell) and [.s Nargothrond]. These "should" be stressed [.s Im<span class="hi">lad</span>ris], [.s Nar<span class="hi">goth</span>rond], because the second-to-last syllable of each is followed by two consonants. However, we can observe that both are stressed on the first syllable in poetry. This issue is covered in depth <a class="pageref" href="#irregular-stress"></a>.

# <a name="selected-vocabulary">Selected Vocabulary</a>

This is just a short selection of the most common Sindarin words. It should be just enough to give you a feel for the sound of the language, and let you practice your pronunciation. A comprehensive dictionary would take a book of its own, but fortunately for me I don't have to write one, since there are several good Sindarin wordlists available online. You can find links to them at the URL below:

N.B.: All of these verbs are given in their _imperative_ or "command" form—so they work for telling someone to do something, but not for describing what they did. For more verb forms, you'll have to read the upcoming chapters!

- [.s Noro!] "Run!"

- [.s Ai!] "Alas!" or "Oh no!"

# <a name="writing-systems">The Tengwar</a>

Tolkien's _tengwar_ script is instantly recognizable—nothing evokes "elvish" like a snippet of _tengwar_ text. It's easy to understand why the _tengwar_ are popular: You don't have to be a Tolkien buff or a language geek to be struck by their one-two punch of badass beauty.

<p class="center text">
[.tai &#187;][.ti AE5,Ex26Yw1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; AE5,ExxwP%1Ej^][.tai &#171;]
</p>
<p class="center text">
[.ti AE5,Ex37zE1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; X#w6Ykt^AT`Bz7qpT1Ej^]
</p>

That's the One Ring inscription, probably the most famous example of the Elvish script. But if you get it tattooed around your arm and claim that it's in an Elvish *language*, the joke's on you—it's actually Sauron's Black Speech, written with _tengwar_ letters. Transcribed into our Roman alphabet, the Ring inscription goes:

<p class="center text">
<em>
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,<br/>
ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
</em>
</p>

Not sounds that any Elf would want to utter!

This serves to highlight an important point: the _tengwar_ aren't a language; they're a writing system that, much like our own alphabet, can be applied to many different languages.

This chapter focuses on writing Sindarin, though there's also a section on how to write English with _tengwar_.

The _tengwar_ were invented by Fëanor in Aman, and so were first used to write Quenya. But Fëanor, always ambitious, didn't just devise an alphabet solely for his own language. He created a system so versatile that it could be adapted to *any* language. Thus when the exiled Noldor brought the _tengwar_ to Middle-earth, the Sindar readily adopted the script. By the Third Age there were multiple styles or "modes" for writing Sindarin with _tengwar_, each with its own spelling conventions.

## The Mode of Beleriand

The _Mode of Beleriand_ is the most ancient of the Sindarin tengwar styles. The letters correspond one-to-one with Sindarin sounds, as shown below:

<sup>&#42;</sup>It's uncertain what letter was used for [.s NG]. David Salo suggests [.t g] in _A Gateway to Sindarin_, as does Måns Björkman on his website _Amanye Tenceli_. It's a reasonable guess since [.t g] is used for _NG_ in Quenya, and fits in with the general pattern of how the _tengwar_ are assigned to sounds in Sindarin.

### Vowels and Diphthongs

Long vowels were given an accent mark: [.t &#93;F] represented [.s á] or [.s â]. The Sindarin term for this is [.s andaith] "long-mark".

For diphthongs, the scribes used a _tengwa_ to represent the first vowel. A mark (_tehta_ in Quenya) above the _tengwa_ represented the second vowel. However, [.s AE] and [.s OE] were often spelled out in full: [.t &#93;l] [.t hl].

### Abbreviations

The early Sindarin scribes liked to abbreviate common letter com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tions. Double [.s NN] and [.s MM] were represented by doubling the curved "bow" of [.t 6] and [.t y], producing [.t 5] and [.t t]. An [.s N] or [.s M] before another consonant was abbreviated as a bar or wavy line above the consonant: [.t 1p] for [.s NT], [.t wP] for [.s MB], etc.

When writing in tengwar, keep in mind that the Elves didn't use our Roman alphabet, so they would have spelled Sindarin words according to their sound and not the letters we use to represent them. [.s Nef] ends with a "v" sound and so should be spelled [.t 6lr] in tengwar. Similarly, [.t m] is only used for [.s LH] when the single sound [.s LH] is meant. [.s Edhelharn], being a compound [.s Edhel] + [.s harn], would be spelt [.t l4lj9&#93;76]. The issue of spelling ambiguities is covered <a class="pageref" href="#splitting-up-letter-combinations"></a>.

[.TODO more on resolving ambiguities between different letter combos]

### A Sample Text

Armed with your new knowledge, you can try deciphering the following tengwar text. Bonus points if you know where it's from!

If you want to try your hand at translating the Sindarin as well, here's a clue: all the words can be found in the vocabulary list that starts <a class="pageref" href="#selected-vocabulary"></a>.

## The Organization of the _Tengwar_

The table of consonants for the Mode of Beleriand is pretty dyslexia-inducing: the letters all look sort of similar but there's no obvious pattern in the way they're assigned to sounds.

In fact, there _is_ a pattern—it's just not apparent when the _tengwar_ are arranged according to our alphabet. Here are the main _tengwar_ as the Elves arranged them:

<table class="col-3 columns">

<li>[.tab NG][.t.letterform g]</li>
<li>[.tab W][.t.letterform n]</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

In the top row are the hard, _unvoiced_ consonants, which all have a downward "stem" (Quenya _telco_) and single "bow" (_lúva_). In the second row, we have the voiced counterparts of these—the voicing being reflected in the _tengwar_ by doubling the _lúva_.

The third and fourth rows are almost a duplicate of the first two—the difference is that the _telqui_ (pl. of _telco_) are extended up instead of down. The associated sounds are _spirants_, which draw out the sound into a hiss or buzz.

The fifth and sixth rows are a little more chaotic, though in the fifth row all the sounds are _nasals_, in which the air is redirected through the nose.

If we look at the _columns_ of the table, a complementary pattern emerges. The first column has all the _dental_ consonants, which place the tip of the tongue on (or just behind) the upper teeth. The second column is all _labial_ consonants, which involve the lips. And the third column is all _velar_ consonants, in which the tongue rises to the roof of the mouth.

Note that the letter [.t f] fills out the pattern but doesn't have an associated Sindarin sound. If we follow the pattern of the other _tengwar_, the sound of [.t f] would be a voiced version of [.s CH]. This gutteral sound doesn't occur in Sindarin but is present in the Black Speech, for example in _agh_ "and".

What about the other _tengwar_, like [.t j], [.t 7], and [.t 8]? Their sounds don't fit into the grid system so nicely, and their irregular shapes (deviating from the _telco_-_lúva_ pattern) reflect this.

## The _Ómatehta_ Mode

_Ómatehtar_ (Quenya for "vowel-signs") are the dots and curls above the letters in the Ring inscription. In LotR Appendix E they're referred to simply as _tehtar_, or "marks". They represent the vowels in many _tengwar_ modes.

_Ómatehtar_ were not used until late in Sindarin's history: the Sindarin _ómatehta_ mode is associated mainly with the Men of Gondor, and is sometimes called the Mode of Gondor.

The consonant letters are almost the same as in the Mode of Beleriand, except for [.s C],  [.s CH], [.s G]. In Gondor, the letters [.t a], [.t s], and [.t d]  were used for writing the sounds _ch_ (as in _church_), _j_, and _sh_, which were common in the Westron language. Gondorians thus preferred to use [.t z], [.t c], and [.t x] for Sindarin [.s C], [.s CH], and [.s G], respectively.

## Writing Tengwar with Mundane Implements

# <a name="imperatives">Wishes, Commands</a>

Now that you've got the basics of how to pronounce and write Sindarin words, it's time to start putting together longer phrases and sentences. To do this, you need to know Sindarin's grammar.

Commands and wishes are among the most common types of Sindarin phrases in Tolkien's writings. For instance, we have:

!!indented

- Glorfindel's cry to his horse Asfaloth: [.s Noro lim, noro lim Asfaloth!] No translation is given, but [.s noro lim] probably means "Run fast!"
- Haldir's command to the Fellowship in Lórien: [.s Daro!] "Halt!"
- Sam's invocation of Elbereth, which ends [.s A tiro nín, Fanuilos!] "O look towards me, Everwhite!"

/!

The common element in all of these examples is a verb ending in [.s -o]: [.s noro], [.s daro], [.s tiro]. This form of the verb is called the _imperative_.

It's not hard to create the imperative form of a verb from its dictionary form: just add [.s o] to the end. If the dictionary form of the verb ends in an [.s a], drop the [.s a] before adding [.s o].

!!indented

- [.s linna-] "sing" &rarr; [.s linno]
- [.s car-] "do" or "make" &rarr; [.s caro]
- [.s beria-] "protect" &rarr; [.s berio]
- [.s cen-] "see" &rarr; [.s ceno]

/!

Note that most Sindarin dictionaries list words by their _stem form_. The stem form often can't stand as a word on its own; you have to add endings to use it in a sentence. To indicate that an ending needs to be added, dictionaries typically add a dash. For example, the online dictionary _Hiswelokë_ lists [.s nor-] as the stem of the verb "to run".

## Direct Objects

Some verbs don't make a whole lot of sense without a target for the action—in grammar terms, a _direct object_. For example, you probably wouldn't say [.s berio!] "protect!" in Sindarin without specifying _what_ to protect.

In Sindarin, as in English, the direct object usually[.TODO how often?] follows the verb.

- [.s Berio i pheriain!] "Protect the hobbits!"
- [.s Anglenno i aran.] "Approach the king."
- [.s Leithio i philin!] "Release the arrows!"

[.TODO it's not clear whether transitive verbs exist as a distinct category in Sindarin, or, if they do, whether they can be used intransitively in the sense of e.g. "protect (things in general)". The most conservative assumption is perhaps that transitive verbs do exist and cannot be used intransitively (unless examples of normally transitive verbs used intransitively exist). However, it should probably be made clear that this is a pretty big and limiting assumption.]

# <a name="possessives">Possessives</a>

Possessive pronouns—_my_, _your_, _their_—tell you who owns something. In English, these precede the noun they're modifying, but in Sindarin they follow it: _[.hi my] book_ vs. [.s parf <span class="hi">nín</span>].

## Vowel Mutation Plurals

In English, we usually form the plural of a noun by adding _-s_: one _wug_, two _wugs_. A few nouns use some kind of vowel mutation instead: one _man_, two _men_, one _goose_, two _geese_.

In Sindarin, this kind of vowel mutation is the normal way of forming plurals. Fortunately, it's quite regular and predictable once you learn the rules.

Each vowel changes in a different way depending on whether it's in the final syllable of a word or not. The changes are shown in the table below. Note that there's no row for [.s I] as it never mutates.

<table class="columns">
<tr class="head">
  <td>Original</td>
  <td>Nonfinal</td>
  <td>Final</td>
  <td>Example</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>[.s A]</td>
  <td>[.s E]</td>
  <td>[.s AI]</td>
  <td>[.s aran] "king" &rarr; [.s erain] "kings"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>[.s E]</td>
  <td>[.s E]</td>
  <td>[.s I]</td>
  <td>[.s edhel] "elf" &rarr; [.s edhil] "elves"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>[.s O]</td>
  <td>[.s E]</td>
  <td>[.s Y]</td>
  <td>[.s Onod] "Ent" &rarr; [.s Enyd] "ents"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>[.s U]</td>
  <td>[.s Y]</td>
  <td>[.s Y]</td>
  <td>[.s curu] "skill" &rarr; [.s cyry] "skills"</td>
</tr>
</table>

The long vowels [.s Ê] and [.s Ô] remained long when mutated: [.s têw] "sign" becomes [.s tîw] in the plural.

How [.s Û] behaved is uncertain, since we have only a single example: [.s Emyn Duir] "dark mountains" as the plural of [.s Amon Dûr][.note _Unfinished Tales_ p. 280]—the adjective [.s dûr] "dark" is affected by the same plural mutation as the noun it modifies. We might tentatively conclude from this that [.s Û] always becomes [.s UI] in the plural.

### Irregular Vowel Mutations

## The Class Plural

In addition to the simple plural to denote more than one of something, Sindarin nouns also have a _class plural_ form denoting *all* of that thing (or at least a very large number). In general, the class plural is formed with a suffix [.s -ath]: [.s Periannath] "Hobbits" from [.s perian]; [.s Sammath] "chambers" from [.s sam].

From the examples given above you'll note that the [.s -ath] suffix can change the final consonant of a word.
