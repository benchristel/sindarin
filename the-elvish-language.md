# <a name="pronunciation">Pronunciation</a>

It's hard to learn pronunciation from a book—an audio recording is worth a thousand words of print. This chapter will give you the basics, but you should also check out the online resources. These include recordings of Tolkien pronouncing Sindarin words from _The Lord of the Rings_—naturally the ultimate source for learning to say them correctly yourself. You can find a list of links at menegroth.github.io/links.html.

Of course, the truly authoritative source for Sindarin pronunciation is Appendix E of _The Lord of the Rings_, upon which much of the material here is based.

## The Sounds of Sindarin

Tolkien's languages have many imitators in fantasy literature, probably because they balance nicely between familiar and exotic. If you pronounce Sindarin like Latin or Greek you won't be far off. Still, Tolkien uses some sounds and spellings that differ enough from English to deserve mention, and these are discussed in detail below. The good news is that Sindarin's spelling is _phonetic_, so if you know how a word is pronounced, you can figure out how to spell it with 100% accuracy.

### Consonants

- [.s C] and [.s G] are always hard, as in _cat_ and _get_. [.s Celeborn] is pronounced "Keleborn".
- [.s CH] is the sound in German _Bach_. If this sound gives you trouble, you could pronounce it [.s H] or [.s K], as the Gondorians did. In the Gondor dialect the place-name [.s Rochann] was pronounced [.s Rohan]—hence the spelling used in _LotR_.
- [.s R] is tapped or trilled, as in Spanish.
- [.s TH] and [.s DH] are the sounds of _thin_ and _this_, respectively. The difference is that when you say _this_ your vocal cords are vibrating—put a finger on your throat and you can feel the difference.
- [.s LH] and [.s RH] are like [.s L] and [.s R] pronounced _voicelessly_—that is, with no vocal cord vibration. These sounds are lifted straight from Welsh, where they're spelled _LL_ and _RH_: _Llewellyn_, _Rhiannon_.
- [.s HW] is similarly a voiceless version of [.s W]. This is the WH-sound in _whale_, in varieties of English that pronounce it differently from _wail_.
- [.s S] is *always* voiceless—it never has a Z-sound, even at the end of a word. The last syllable of [.s Fanuilos] "Everwhite" sounds like _loss_.
- [.s NG], between vowels, is pronounced with a hard [.s G] as in _finger_. elsewhere, it's pronounced as in _ring_.

### Vowels

The vowel letters A, E, I, O, and U correspond one-to-one with the vowel sounds "ah", "eh", "ee", "oh", "oo". Tolkien was aiming for familiarity here: Spanish, Italian, and many other languages have similar vowel systems.

Even English, for all its crazy spelling, sometimes uses the five vowels with their Sindarin pronunciations:

- [.s A]: &ldquo;f[.hi a]ther&rdquo;
- [.s E]: &ldquo;w[.hi e]ll&rdquo;
- [.s I]: &ldquo;mach[.hi i]ne&rdquo;
- [.s O]: &ldquo;f[.hi o]r&rdquo;
- [.s U]: &ldquo;br[.hi u]te&rdquo;

With those examples in mind, try pronouncing these words:

- [.s ungol] "spider"
- [.s lembas] "waybread"
- [.s Legolas] "Greenleaf"
- [.s Osgiliath] "Citadel of the Stars"

In addition to the five main vowels, Sindarin has a sixth vowel [.s Y] with no equivalent in English. It's the sound of _u_ in French _lune_, or _ü_ in German _über_. To pronounce it, say "ee" but with your lips rounded as if saying "oo".

If those instructions sound nonsensical, it's because "ee" usually stretches your lips into a smile, basically the opposite of "oo". (That's why people say "cheese" for photos!) However, the other important feature of "ee" is that your mouth is nearly closed when saying it, leaving only a small air gap above your tongue. So combine that "closeness" with lip-rounding and you have the Sindarin [.s Y] sound.

In Gondor, [.s Y] was often pronounced the same as [.s I]—the Gondorians found this sound as troublesome as we do.

### Accents and Vowel Length

An acute accent ([.s á é í ó ú ý]) indicates that the vowel is held for a slightly longer duration. So in a word like [.s míriel] "sparkling like jewels", the first syllable [.s mí] is held about twice as long as the second syllable [.s ri].

A circumflex ([.s â ê î ô û ŷ]) also indicates a long vowel, but is mostly used in words of one syllable. This may just be an aesthetic whim of Tolkien's, though he justified it by saying that vowels with the circumflex should be held _even longer_. However, the Elvish writing systems only distinguish two vowel lengths, long and short, so the Elves must not have considered this detail very important.

### Diphthongs

A diphthong (pronounced [.pron DIFF-thong], from the Greek for "two sounds") is a combination of two vowel sounds that blur together into a single syllable. Diphthongs appear frequently in English, like the "ou" in "house" that starts with an "ah" sound and ends with an "oo" sound. Sindarin has a similar diphthong, spelled [.s au].

Here is the complete list of Sindarin diphthongs:

* [.s AI]: as in &ldquo;[.hi ai]sle&rdquo;
* [.s AE]: no English equivalent. [.s AE] is a glide from an [.s A] into an [.s E]. The resulting sound should be similar to [.s AI]; Tolkien even suggested pronouncing [.s AE] the same as [.s AI] if you're not picky. Or you could aim for a Mirkwood accent and pronounce it like [.s E]: compare Mirkwood [.s Legolas] to Classical Sindarin [.s Laegolas].
* [.s AU]: like _ou_ in &ldquo;h[.hi ou]se&rdquo;.
* [.s EI]: as in &ldquo;w[.hi ei]gh&rdquo;
* [.s OE]: like _oy_ in &ldquo;b[.hi oy]&rdquo;, but ending in an "eh" sound.
* [.s UI]: as in _ruin_, but ending in an "ee" sound rather than the "ih" sound. Tolkien noted that this was a "long diphthong" and scanned as two syllables in poetry: hence [.s Fanuilos, le linnathon] in the Hymn to Elbereth, where the meter requires eight syllables per line.

## Special Cases

### At the end of a word:

* [.s V]: The [.s V]-sound is spelled [.s F] at the end of a word: [.s nef] "on this side of" is pronounced as _nev_ in _never_. When the [.s F]-sound occurs at the end of a word, it's spelled [.s PH], as in [.s alph] "swan". This quirk of spelling probably hearkens back to Tolkien's fondness for Welsh, where _F_ has a V-sound.
* [.s AU] is spelled [.s AW] word-finally: [.s caw] "top" sounds very similar to _cow_.
* [.s W] can occur word-finally, which can be troublesome for English-speakers. To pronounce [.s têw] "letter", try saying "teh win" but stop at the _w_. In any case, [.s têw] should never be pronounced as if it rhymes with _new_.

### At the beginning of a word

* [.s IA], [.s IAU], [.s IE], [.s IO], [.s IUI]: When these combinations appear word-initially, the [.s I] sounds like the _y_ in _yes_. So [.s ionnath] "sons" and [.s Ioreth] "Old Woman" begin with a _yo_ sound.
* [.s ND], [.s MB], [.s NG]: These clusters can occur at the beginning of a word. Pronouncing these sounds is arguably the most challenging aspect of Sindarin pronunciation for English speakers, though it can certainly be mastered with practice. You may be happy to know that these word-initial clusters only arise due to mutations and therefore almost always follow a vowel, as in [.s i mbair] "the lands". This makes things somewhat easier; if you say _im bair_ probably no one will notice.

To complicate matters, the spelling [.s NG] is actually ambiguous at the beginning of a word. Sometimes it represents a single, unitary sound, the _ng_ in _ring_, while at other times it represents that sound plus _g_, as in _finger_. Each sound arises from a different type of mutation. At this point, you don't have to worry about the distinction—pronouncing either of these sounds correctly is hard enough for a first lesson!

## Long Consonants

In addition to having long and short vowels, Sindarin makes a contrast between long and short consonants. English also has this contrast in a few cases: _unaimed_ has a short _n_, while _unnamed_ (if you're trying to pronounce it differently from _unaimed_) has a long _n_.

In Sindarin spelling, a doubled letter means the consonant is long. For example, [.s melon] "I love" has a short [.s L], while [.s mellon] "friend" has a long [.s L].

[.s PH] is a tricky exception: at the beginning or end of a word it's a short [.s F]-sound, pronounced as in _photograph_. However, in the middle of a word, it's long: [.s ephel] "outer fence" is pronounced _ef-fel_.

[.TODO wtf is the deal with M vs MM? or S vs SS?]

## <a name="splitting-up-letter-combinations">Spelling Ambiguities</a>

The modern English alphabet simply doesn't have enough letters to represent Sindarin unambiguously. In compound words especially, confusion can arise.

The combinations [.s DH], [.s LH], [.s RH], [.s TH] sometimes represent a sequence of two distinct sounds, e.g. [.s T]+[.s H]. For example, [.s Panthael] ("Fullwise", a name given to Sam Gamgee by Aragorn), is a compound [.s pant+hael], so the [.s t] and [.s h] are pronounced separately, as in _anthill_, not as in _anthem_. Similarly, [.s Edhelharn] "Elfstone", is a compound [.s edhel+harn].

So how do you know when to pronounce the letter-sequence "th" as [.s T]+[.s H], and when to pronounce it as a single sound? The answer, unfortunately, is that you just have to memorize the (rare) cases where "th" represents [.s T]+[.s H].

It's worth noting that the sounds [.s LH] and [.s RH] can't occur in the middle of a word, so if you see a word like [.s Edhelharn] or [.s Perhael] "Halfwise", you know that the [.s H] should be a separate sound.

The Elvish writing system _tengwar_ doesn't have this ambiguity, because the sounds [.s DH], [.s LH], [.s RH], [.s TH] each have their own symbol. So recognizing letter combinations that should be split up isn't just relevant for pronunciation—you need to know this to write in tengwar, as well!

## Stress

Sindarin, like English, puts emphasis or _stress_ on one syllable of multi-syllable words. In English, stress can alter the meaning of a word, as in the following:

> Sam received a **present** from Galadriel.
> We have to **present** our project to the class.

With the first syllable stressed, &ldquo;[.hi pre]sent&rdquo; is a noun. Stress the second syllable, &ldquo;pre[.hi sent]&rdquo;, and it becomes a verb.

In Sindarin, the stress of a word can't change its meaning, but it's vital to learn how words are stressed in order to write poetry. If you pronounce words with the wrong stress, you'll just sound weird.

Fortunately, Sindarin stress is predicatable from the shape of the word, so you don't have to memorize where the stress falls for each word individually. This section describes how to figure out which syllable is stressed.

### Syllables

Before you can place the stress in a word, you have to break it down into syllables. Many people find this difficult at first, but there's a trick to it: look at the vowels.

Each syllable has exactly one vowel or diphthong at its core—no more, no less. So [.s Elbereth Gilthoniel] breaks down as [.s El&middot;be&middot;reth Gil&middot;tho&middot;ni&middot;el]. [.s Thranduil] has only two syllables, [.s Thran&middot;duil], because [.s ui] is a diphthong.

### Stress in Two-Syllable Words

Tolkien states in Appendix E that "[i]n words of two syllables, [the stress] falls in practically all cases on the first syllable". Thus we have [.s <span class="hi">Per</span>&middot;hael] "Samwise", [.s <span class="hi">El</span>&middot;rond].

### Stress in Longer Words

The general rule for longer words is to stress the third-to-last syllable: [.s <span class="hi">El</span>&middot;be&middot;reth], [.s Gil&middot;<span class="hi">tho</span>&middot;ni&middot;el], [.s <span class="hi">Le</span>&middot;go&middot;las]

However, the second-to-last syllable gets the stress if its vowel is:

- long (accented), as [.s í] in [.s Celeb<span class="hi">rí</span>an] ("Silver-queen", Arwen's mother)
- a diphthong, as [.s ae] in [.s Hi<span class="hi">thaeg</span>lir] ("the Misty Mountains")
- or followed by multiple consonants: [.s Cele<span class="hi">brim</span>bor] ("Silver-fist")

Note that in the last case it's consonant *sounds*, not letters, that are important. [.s TH], [.s DH], etc. are single sounds even though they're represented by two letters, so the [.s th] in [.s <span class="hi">Nim</span>brethil] doesn't cause the stress to move.

### Possible Exceptions to the Stress Rule

There are some Sindarin names that don't seem to follow the stress rules in Appendix E, among them [.s Imladris] (Rivendell) and [.s Nargothrond]. These "should" be stressed [.s Im<span class="hi">lad</span>ris], [.s Nar<span class="hi">goth</span>rond], because the second-to-last syllable of each is followed by two consonants. However, we can observe that both are stressed on the first syllable in poetry. This issue is covered in depth <a class="pageref" href="#irregular-stress"></a>.

# <a name="writing-systems">The Tengwar</a>

Tolkien's _tengwar_ script is instantly recognizable—nothing evokes "elvish" like a snippet of _tengwar_ text. It's easy to understand why the _tengwar_ are popular—you don't have to be a Tolkien buff or a language geek to be struck by their beauty.

<p class="center text">
[.tai &#187;][.ti AE5,Ex26Yw1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; AE5,ExxwP%1Ej^][.tai &#171;]
</p>
<p class="center text">
[.ti AE5,Ex37zE1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; X#w6Ykt^AT`Bz7qpT1Ej^]
</p>

That's the One Ring inscription, probably the most famous example of the Elvish script. But if you get it tattooed around your arm and claim that it's in an Elvish *language*, the joke's on you—it's actually Sauron's Black Speech, written with _tengwar_ letters. Transcribed into our Roman alphabet, the Ring inscription goes:

<p class="center text">
<em>
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,<br/>
ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
</em>
</p>

Not sounds that any Elf would want to utter!

This serves to highlight an important point: the _tengwar_ aren't a language; they're a writing system that, much like our own alphabet, can be applied to many different languages.

This chapter focuses on writing Sindarin, though there's also a section on how to write English with _tengwar_.

The _tengwar_ were invented by Fëanor in Aman, and so were first used to write Quenya. But Fëanor, always ambitious, didn't just devise an alphabet solely for his own language. He created a system so versatile that it could be adapted to *any* language. Thus when the exiled Noldor brought the _tengwar_ to Middle-earth, they were able to use the script to write Sindarin. By the Third Age there were multiple styles or "modes" for writing Sindarin with _tengwar_, each with its own spelling conventions.

## The Mode of Beleriand

The _Mode of Beleriand_ is the most ancient of the Sindarin tengwar styles. The letters correspond one-to-one with Sindarin sounds, as shown below:

@include mode-of-beleriand-consonants.md

### Vowels and Diphthongs

Long vowels were given an accent mark: [.t &#93;F] represented [.s á] or [.s â]. The Sindarin term for this is [.s andaith] "long-mark".

For diphthongs, the scribes used a _tengwa_ to represent the first vowel. A mark (_tehta_ in Quenya) above the _tengwa_ was often used for the second vowel. However, Tolkien notes in Appendix E that "the diphthongs were often written out in full", as [.t &#93;l] in the _tengwar_ transcription of _A Elbereth Gilthoniel_.

### Abbreviations

The early Sindarin scribes liked to abbreviate common letter com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tions. Double [.s NN] and [.s MM] were represented by doubling the curved "bow" of [.t 6] and [.t y], producing [.t 5] and [.t t]. An [.s N] or [.s M] before another consonant was abbreviated as a bar or wavy line above the consonant: [.t 1p] for [.s NT], [.t wP] for [.s MB], etc.

### The Complicated Matter of _W_

A mark like a flattened S (also used for the diphthong [.s AU]) might have been used for a following [.s W] sound: [.s Narwain] "January" might have been written [.t 6&#93;7ê&#93;Ö6]. In Appendix E, Tolkien mentions that this symbol was "required for the expression of <em>au</em>, <em>aw</em>," perhaps meaning that it was used only in that circumstance, and [.t n] was used elsewhere for [.s W].
For [.s GW], there is an additional layer of complication. The Noldor, on first encountering Sindarin, would likely have used [.t x] for [.s GW], since that spelling closely mirrors Quenya. [.s Gwirith] "April" might be written [.t x&#96;7&#96;3]. This ties in nicely with the use of [.t c] for [.s CHW], which Tolkien implies (but does not quite state) in Appendix E: <q><em>hwesta sindarinwa</em> [[.t o]] or <q>Grey-elven <em>hw</em></q> was so called because in Quenya [[.t c]] had the sound of <em>hw</em>, and distinct signs for <em>chw</em> and <em>hw</em> were not required.</q>

Thus, the possibilities for writing [.s GW] are:

- [.t x&#96;7&#96;3] &middot; [.s Gwirith]
- [.t sè&#96;7&#96;3] &middot; [.s Gwirith]
- [.t sn&#96;7&#96;3] &middot; [.s Gwirith]

Which of these was used is not certain.

For other consonant clusters ending in [.s W], there are only two possibilities: the [.t &nbsp;ê]-_tehta_ or the _tengwa_ [.t n].

- [.t 6&#93;7ê&#93;Ö6] &middot; [.s Narwain]
- [.t 6&#93;7n&#93;Ö6] &middot; [.s Narwain]

### Ambiguities

When writing in tengwar, keep in mind that the Elves didn't use our Roman alphabet, so they would have spelled Sindarin words according to their sound and not the letters we use to represent them. [.s Nef] ends with a "v" sound and so should be spelled [.t 6lr] in tengwar. Similarly, [.t m] is only used for [.s LH] when the single sound [.s LH] is meant. [.s Edhelharn], being a compound [.s Edhel] + [.s harn], would be spelt [.t l4lj9&#93;76]. The issue of spelling ambiguities is covered <a class="pageref" href="#splitting-up-letter-combinations"></a>.

If you want to try your hand at translating the Sindarin as well, here's a clue: all the words can be found in the vocabulary list that starts <a class="pageref" href="#selected-vocabulary"></a>.

## The Organization of the _Tengwar_

The table of consonants for the Mode of Beleriand is pretty dyslexia-inducing: the letters all look sort of similar but there's no obvious pattern in the way they're assigned to sounds.

In fact, there _is_ a pattern—it's just not apparent when the _tengwar_ are arranged according to our alphabet. Here are the main _tengwar_ as the Elves arranged them:

<table class="col-3 columns">
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>[.tab T][.t.letterform 1]</li>
<li>[.tab D][.t.letterform 2]</li>
<li>[.tab TH][.t.letterform 3]</li>

<li>[.tab NG][.t.letterform g]</li>
<li>[.tab O][.t.letterform h]</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

In the top row are the hard, _unvoiced_ consonants, which all have a downward "stem" (Quenya _telco_) and single "bow" (_lúva_). In the second row, we have the voiced counterparts of these—the voicing being reflected in the _tengwar_ by doubling the _lúva_.

The third and fourth rows are almost a duplicate of the first two—the difference is that the _telqui_ (pl. of _telco_) are extended up instead of down. The associated sounds are _spirants_, which draw out the sound into a hiss or buzz.

The fifth and sixth rows are a little more chaotic; [.t h] for [.s O] is the odd letter out as all the others represent _nasals_ (sounds that redirect air through the nose).

If we look at the _columns_ of the table, a complementary pattern emerges. The first column has all the _dental_ consonants, which place the tip of the tongue on (or just behind) the upper teeth. The second column is all _labial_ consonants, which involve the lips. And the third column (with the exception of the outlier [.t h]) is all _velar_ consonants, in which the tongue rises to the roof of the mouth.

Note that the letter [.t f] fills out the pattern but doesn't have an associated Sindarin sound. If we follow the pattern of the other _tengwar_, the sound of [.t f] would be a voiced version of [.s CH]. This gutteral sound doesn't occur in Sindarin but is present in the Black Speech, for example in _agh_ "and".

What about the other _tengwar_, like [.t j], [.t 7], and [.t 8]? Their sounds don't fit into the grid system so nicely, and their irregular shapes (deviating from the _telco_-_lúva_ pattern) reflect this.

## The _Ómatehta_ Mode

_Ómatehtar_ (Quenya for "vowel-signs") are the dots and curls above the letters in the Ring inscription. In LotR Appendix E they're referred to simply as _tehtar_, or "marks". They represent the vowels in many _tengwar_ modes.

_Ómatehtar_ were not used until late in Sindarin's history. The Sindarin _ómatehta_ mode is associated mainly with the Men of Gondor, and is sometimes called the Mode of Gondor.

The consonant letters follow mostly the same patterns in the Mode of Beleriand, but except for [.s C],  [.s CH], [.s G]. In Gondor, the letters [.t a], [.t s], and [.t d]  were used for writing the sounds _ch_ (as in _church_), _j_, and _sh_, which were common in the Westron language. Gondorians thus preferred to use [.t z], [.t c], and [.t x] for Sindarin [.s C], [.s CH], and [.s G].

Vowels are indicated by a _tehta_ above the following consonant.

What if there's no consonant immediately following the vowel? In that case, the vowel _tehta_ is placed on a carrier _tengwa_ [.t &#96;]. The carrier has no sound of its own; it just gives the _tehta_ a place to sit.

- [.t q2$&#96;N] &middot; [.s pedo] "speak"
- [.t xj%35^&#96;Bj$] &middot; [.s Gilthoniel]

For long vowels, the _andaith_ of course can't be used. Instead, the vowel _tehta_ is placed on a long carrier letter [.t ~]. This type of carrier is used even if there's a following consonant.

- [.t t~B7&#96;Bj$] &middot; [.s míriel]

### R, S, and Y

The _ómatehta_ mode uses two different letters for [.s R]: [.t 7] and [.t 6]. [.t 6] is used at the end of words, while [.t 7] is used elsewhere.

### Abbreviations

The _ómatehta_ mode uses the same abbreviations as the Mode of Beleriand, plus a few more. A bar below a _tengwa_ indicates that the letter is doubled. However, double [.s NN] and [.s MM] use the wavy line above instead—just like in the Mode of Beleriand, this indicates a preceding nasal sound.

## Writing Tengwar with Mundane Implements

# <a name="imperatives">Wishes, Commands</a>

Now that you've got the basics of how to pronounce and write Sindarin words, it's time to start putting together longer phrases and sentences. To do this, you need to know Sindarin's grammar.

Commands and wishes are among the most common types of Sindarin phrases in Tolkien's writings. For instance, we have:

!!indented

- Glorfindel's cry to his horse Asfaloth: [.s Noro lim, noro lim Asfaloth!] No translation is given, but [.s noro lim] probably means "Run fast!"
- Haldir's command to the Fellowship in Lórien: [.s Daro!] "Halt!"
- Sam's invocation of Elbereth, which ends [.s A tiro nín, Fanuilos!] "O look towards me, Everwhite!"

/!

The common element in all of these examples is a verb ending in [.s -o]: [.s noro], [.s daro], [.s tiro]. This form of the verb is called the _imperative_.

It's not hard to create the imperative form of a verb from its dictionary form: just add [.s o] to the end. If the dictionary form of the verb ends in an [.s a], drop the [.s a] before adding [.s o].

- [.s linna-] "sing" &rarr; [.s linno]

- [.s beria-] "protect" &rarr; [.s berio]
- [.s cen-] "see" &rarr; [.s ceno]

Note that most Sindarin dictionaries list words by their _stem form_. The stem form often can't stand as a word on its own; you have to add endings to use it in a sentence. To indicate that an ending needs to be added, dictionaries typically add a dash. For example, the online dictionary _Hiswelokë_ lists [.s nor-] as the stem of the verb "to run".

## Direct Objects

Some verbs don't make a whole lot of sense without a target for the action—in grammar terms, a _direct object_. For example, you probably wouldn't say [.s berio!] "protect!" in Sindarin without specifying _what_ to protect.

In Sindarin, as in English, the direct object usually[.TODO how often?] follows the verb.

- [.s Berio i pheriain!] "Protect the hobbits!"
- [.s Anglenno i aran.] "Approach the king."
- [.s Leithio i philin!] "Release the arrows!"

[.TODO it's not clear whether transitive verbs exist as a distinct category in Sindarin, or, if they do, whether they can be used intransitively in the sense of e.g. "protect (things in general)". The most conservative assumption is perhaps that transitive verbs do exist and cannot be used intransitively (unless examples of normally transitive verbs used intransitively exist). However, it should probably be made clear that this is a pretty big and limiting assumption.]

# <a name="possessives">Possessives</a>

Possessive pronouns—_my_, _your_, _their_—tell you who owns something. In English, these precede the noun they're modifying, but in Sindarin they follow it: _[.hi my] book_ vs. [.s parf <span class="hi">nín</span>].

## Vowel Mutation Plurals

In English, we usually form the plural of a noun by adding _-s_: one _wug_, two _wugs_. A few nouns use some kind of vowel mutation instead: one _man_, two _men_, one _goose_, two _geese_.

In Sindarin, this kind of vowel mutation is the normal way of forming plurals. Fortunately, it's quite regular and predictable once you learn the rules.

Each vowel changes in a different way depending on whether it's in the final syllable of a word or not. The changes are shown in the table below. Note that there's no row for [.s I] as it never mutates.

<table class="columns">
<tr class="head">
  <td>Original</td>
  <td>Nonfinal</td>
  <td>Final</td>
  <td>Example</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>[.s A]</td>
  <td>[.s E]</td>
  <td>[.s AI]</td>
  <td>[.s aran] "king" &rarr; [.s erain] "kings"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>[.s E]</td>
  <td>[.s E]</td>
  <td>[.s I]</td>
  <td>[.s edhel] "elf" &rarr; [.s edhil] "elves"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>[.s O]</td>
  <td>[.s E]</td>
  <td>[.s Y]</td>
  <td>[.s Onod] "Ent" &rarr; [.s Enyd] "ents"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>[.s U]</td>
  <td>[.s Y]</td>
  <td>[.s Y]</td>
  <td>[.s curu] "skill" &rarr; [.s cyry] "skills"</td>
</tr>
</table>

The long vowels [.s Ê] and [.s Ô] remained long when mutated: [.s têw] "sign" becomes [.s tîw] in the plural.

How [.s Û] behaved is uncertain, since we have only a single example: [.s Emyn Duir] "dark mountains" as the plural of [.s Amon Dûr][.note _Unfinished Tales_ p. 280]—the adjective [.s dûr] "dark" is affected by the same plural mutation as the noun it modifies. We might tentatively conclude from this that [.s Û] always becomes [.s UI] in the plural.

### Irregular Vowel Mutations

## The Class Plural

In addition to the simple plural to denote more than one of something, Sindarin nouns also have a _class plural_ form denoting *all* of that thing (or at least a very large number). In general, the class plural is formed with a suffix [.s -ath]: [.s Periannath] "Hobbits" from [.s perian]; [.s Sammath] "chambers" from [.s sam].

From the examples given above you'll note that the [.s -ath] suffix can change the final consonant of a word.
