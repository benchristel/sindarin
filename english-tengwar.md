The _tengwar_ (Quenya for "signs") were the Elvish script in
widest use during the Third Age. Following their invention
by the elf Fëanor, they were adapted to many languages and
in time became the dominant writing system of Middle-earth.

Even Sauron used _tengwar_ to inscribe the One Ring:

<p class="center text">
[.tai &#187;][.ti AE5,Ex26Yw1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; AE5,ExxwP%1Ej^][.tai &#171;]
</p>
<p class="center text">
[.ti AE5,Ex37zE1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; X#w6Ykt^AT`Bz7qpT1Ej^]
</p>

It is worth noting that the One Ring inscription is not
"in Elvish". Though the letters are of Elvish design, the
language is Sauron's Black Speech.
Transcribed into our Roman alphabet, the Ring inscription goes:

<p class="center text">
<em>
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,<br/>
ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
</em>
</p>

Not sounds that any Elf would want to utter!

The great versatility of the _tengwar_ in writing different
languages led in Middle-earth to an explosion of spelling
systems, called [.term tengwar modes], among which scribes
could choose according to their whim or the custom of their
time and place. Each mode was specific to a language—some
were only for Sindarin, some for Quenya, some for Westron—but
a single language could have many modes.
By the Third Age there were at least three
different Sindarin modes in use.

There was no mode in Middle-earth for writing English, of
course, but
Tolkien did create _tengwar_ inscriptions in several
different English modes.
One of them was used in the _Lord of the Rings_
films, and is presented here. Its first known use is in a Christmas letter Tolkien wrote
to a fan, Hugh Brogan, so we'll call it the Brogan Mode.

Figure 1 shows the main letters with their English
equivalents.

The two _tengwar_ letters corresponding to TH are used for
different sounds: [.t 3] as in _thin_ or _wreath_ and [.t 4] as in
_this_ or _wreathe_. The two letters for Z come from different
sources: Tolkien used [.t k], but [.t ,] was used in the
_Lord of the Rings_ movies.

When you're putting these together into words, make sure the central curly bits (_lúvar_ in Quenya) of the letters all sit on the same line. Here's an example:

!!example

[.t 4\`8 whhz 1ljj8 he 4l jnbynxl8 he 4l ljrl8 n52 9h7 4l~ n6l 8qhzl5 n52 76\`11l5]

/!

And here is the same text in a cursive style:

!!example

[.ti 4\`8 whhz 1ljj8 he 4l jnbynxl8 he 4l ljrl8 n52 9h7 3l~ n6l 8qhzl5 n52 76\`11l5]

/!

Here's a rather silly sentence that uses all the letters. The dots between words are _tengwar_ commas.

!!example

[.t c\`jjnz| = zêh3 4l x6ytq~ o\`1l 7\`,n62 = \`5rhz\`b 9\`8 e\`v1\`b wn5fh e\`d]

/!

[.t.TODO x6ytq~ 7\`,n628 wnzl 1hz|\`a w6l7 eh6 4l lr\`j zêll5 n52 fnaz]

## Punctuation

The details of _Tengwar_ punctuation seem traditionally to
have been up to the discretion and personal style of the
scribe. A few regular conventions, however, were widely
observed.

Many punctuation marks consisted of single dots or groups
of dots, which could be stacked vertically or arranged into
diamond or square patterns. In general, more dots indicated
a longer pause. A single dot was often used where in English
we'd use a comma; two dots could be used to indicate a
longer pause, a semicolon, or a full stop. Four dots in a
diamond or square
often marked the end of a paragraph, but might also
simply end a sentence.

A long dash was sometimes used—as in English—to set off
a parenthetical remark from the surrounding text.

The Elves also used marks similar in function to our
question mark ([.t À]) and exclamation point ([.t Á]).
They could be combined with other punctuation
marks, so a question mark at the end of a sentence could
be written [.t À-].

!!TODO

Why would you want a question mark or exclamation point
that's *not* at the
end of a sentence? Here are some examples:

[.t oh n6l ~hyÀ= \`e ~hy 2h51 t\`52 1ljj\`b tl-] ~ _Who
are you, if you don't mind telling me?_

[.t oh n6l ~hyÀ= \`e ~hy 2h51 t\`52 1ljj\`b tl-]

## Word Abbreviations

The Brogan English mode abbreviates several common words:
[.t 2P] "and", [.t @] "the", [.t W] "of", and [.t W:] "of the". So _A tale of hobbits and the Lord of the Rings_
could be written [.t n 1njl W 9hww\`18 2P @ jh62 W: 6\`b8].

These abbreviations are presented in Figure 4.

## Letter Abbreviations

Several types of _tehtar_, or marks, can be used to
abbreviate certain letter combinations.

### Double Letters

A letter can be doubled by writing a bar underneath it.
Thus: [.t jl1&apos;l6] "letter", [.t qh&apos;z] "book", [.t alj°n6 2h&apos;6] "cellar door".

### Nasal Clusters

Consonant clusters beginning with an N or M (the so-called nasal consonants)
can be abbreviated. Instead of writing the N or M out in full, you
can write a wavy line above the following consonant. [.t lwPl6] "ember",
[.t 7n2P] "wand", [.t anqp] "camp", [.t 8jn1p] "slant". When the combination
NG represents some sound other than that heard in "ring" (for example, N with a hard G as in "finger" or a soft G as in "ranger"), it can also be abbreviated: [.t cnxPl] "change".

### Silent E

To abbreviate a silent E, place
a dot under the consonant before it: [.t 7nrÈ] "wave", [.t 7l6É] "were",
[.t 3~tÈ] "thyme".

### Final S

A single S at the end of a word can be reduced to a "hook"
shape extending from the next-to-last letter: [.t ny1p+] "aunts",
[.t w6lnz¢] "breaks", [.t enj°¥] "falls". This can be combined with
the silent-E dot: [.t 9hqÉ+] "hopes".

The S can also be written in full: [.t tn,l8] "mazes".

### W and U

When W is the second element of a consonant cluster such as
TW or DW, it can be abbreviated as a mark like a flattened S:
[.t 1êh 2èn6rÉ+] "two dwarves". W or U after a vowel can
be abbreviated the same way: [.t 8nê] "saw", [.t 9hê8É] "house",
[.t 5lê8] "news".

## Dotting the I

The _tengwa_ for I can be capped with a dot ([.t \`B]) or accent ([.t \`V])
to make it more visible.
Which one you use is up to your personal taste.
Tolkien seems to have preferred
the accent, while in the movies a dot (or the absence of any mark)
is more frequent.
