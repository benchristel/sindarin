The _tengwar_ (Quenya for "signs") were the Elvish script in
widest use during the Third Age. Following their invention
by the elf Fëanor, they were adapted to many languages and
in time became the dominant writing system of Middle-earth.

Even Sauron used _tengwar_ to inscribe the One Ring:

<p class="center text">
[.tai &#187;][.ti AE5,Ex26Yw1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; AE5,ExxwP%1Ej^][.tai &#171;]
</p>
<p class="center text">
[.ti AE5,Ex37zE1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; X#w6Ykt^AT`Bz7qpT1Ej^]
</p>

It is worth noting that the One Ring inscription is not
"in Elvish". Though the letters are of Elvish design, the
language is Sauron's Black Speech.
Transcribed into our Roman alphabet, the Ring inscription goes:

<p class="center text">
<em>
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,<br/>
ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
</em>
</p>

Not sounds that any Elf would want to utter!

The great versatility of the _tengwar_ in writing different
languages led in Middle-earth to an explosion of spelling
systems, called [.term tengwar modes], among which scribes
could choose according to their whim or the custom of their
time and place. Each mode was specific to a language—some
were only for Sindarin, some for Quenya, some for Westron—but
a single language could have many modes.
By the Third Age there were at least three
different Sindarin modes in use.

There was no mode in Middle-earth for writing English, of
course, but
Tolkien did create _tengwar_ inscriptions in several
different English modes.
One of Tolkien's English modes was used in the _Lord of the Rings_
films, and is presented here. It first appeared in a Christmas letter Tolkien wrote
to a fan, Hugh Brogan, so we'll call it the Brogan Mode.

Figure 1 shows the main letters with their English
equivalents.

The two _tengwar_ letters corresponding to TH are used for
different sounds: [.t 3] as in _thin_ or _wreath_ and [.t 4] as in
_this_ or _wreathe_.

When you're putting these together into words, make sure the central curly bits (_lúvar_ in Quenya) of the letters all sit on the same line. Here's an example:

!!example

[.t 4\`8 whhz 1ljj8 he 4l jnbynxl8 he 4l ljrl8 n52 9h7 4l~ n6l 8qhzl5 n52 76\`11l5]

/!

And here is the same text in a cursive style:

!!example

[.ti 4\`8 whhz 1ljj8 he 4l jnbynxl8 he 4l ljrl8 n52 9h7 3l~ n6l 8qhzl5 n52 76\`11l5]

/!

Here's a rather silly sentence that uses all the letters. The dots between words are _tengwar_ commas.

!!example

[.t c\`jjnz| = zêh3 4l x6ytq~ o\`1l 7\`,n62 = \`5rhz\`b e\`rl 9nd wn5fh8]

## Punctuation

_Tengwar_ punctuation seems traditionally to have been up
to the discretion of the individual scribe.

Most of the punctuation marks are groups of dots vertically centered on the _lúvar_ of the text. These dots can either be stacked vertically, lined up horizontally, or clustered. In general, the more dots there are, the longer of a pause they indicate.

Other punctuation marks include the swung dash, the question mark, and the exclamation point.

## Word Abbreviations

The

## Letter Abbreviations

The English mode uses several _tehtar_, or marks, to
abbreviate certain letter combinations.

### Double Letters

A letter can be doubled by writing a bar underneath it.

### Nasal Clusters

Consonant clusters beginning with an N or M (the so-called nasal consonants)
can be abbreviated. Instead of writing the N or M out in full, you
can write a wavy line above the following consonant.

### Silent E

A silent E at the end of a word can be abbreviated by placing
a dot under the preceding consonant.

## Structure and Organization of the Tengwar

Many of the _tengwar_ letters seem to be variations on a
theme: one or two loops and a long stem pointing up or down.
This is by design: the _tengwar_ are a partly [.term featural script],
in which the shape of a letter tells you how that letter sounds.
The regularity of the system can make memorizing
the _tengwar_ a bit easier.

Figure 2 shows the main _tengwar_ in the
arrangement traditionally used by the Elves. In this arrangement, the
patterns of sound and shape become evident.

### The Four _Témar_

The Elves grouped the _tengwar_ into four _témar_ (Quenya for "series"),
which are represented by the four columns of Figure 2.
Their names are, in order from left to right: _tincotéma_,
_parmatéma_, _calmatéma_, and _quessetéma_. The _témar_ are named
after their first letters [.t 1], [.t q], [.t a], and [.t z],
called _tinco_ "metal", _parma_ "book", _calma_ "lamp", and _quessë_ "feather" in Quenya.
The Elves considered these four letters to be the
fundamental _tengwar_-shapes. The other _tengwar_ in Figure 2 are
variations on the four basic shapes.

### The Six _Tyeller_

The six rows of Figure 2 correspond to the six _tyeller_ or  "grades"
of letters recognized by the Elves. Each _tyellë_ was used
for sounds of a specific quality.

#### The First Row

The letters of the first row, [.t 1], [.t q], [.t a], and [.t z],
represent unvoiced [.term plosives]. These sounds
stop the breath completely and release it suddenly with a little pop.
See the section on pronunciation [.TODO link] for an
explanation of voiced vs. unvoiced sounds.

#### The Second Row

The second row is formed by doubling the _lúva_ or "bow" of
the fundamental letters. This adds [.term voice] to the
sound, making the "pop" a bit duller. Thus we get the sounds
of [.t 2], [.t w], and [.t x] ([.t s] isn't used in the
English mode).

#### The Third and Fourth Rows

These rows are formed from the first two by extending the
_telco_ or "stem" of each letter upward. This makes the
sounds into [.term fricatives], which constrict the flow
of breath but don't quite stop it. This results in a sound
like a fizz (if unvoiced) or a buzz (if voiced). As in the
first two rows, voice is added to a sound if the _lúva_ is
doubled.

The resulting sounds are unvoiced [.t 3] TH (as in _cloth_), [.t w] F, [.t d] SH,
and [.t c] CH, and voiced [.t 4] TH (as in _clothes_), [.t r] V,
and [.t f] J.

#### The Fifth and Sixth Rows

In the last two rows, the _telco_ is shortened to be the
same height as the _lúvar_. The Elves typically used these
letters for [.term nasal consonants] like N, M, and NG.

Here, the doubled _lúva_ again corresponds to a voiced
sound, but the single-_lúva_ letters are not their unvoiced
counterparts.
The major Elvish languages lacked unvoiced nasals (so does English),
so the Elves typically used these letters for vowels or
[.term semivowels] like Y and W. The English mode follows
this tradition and assigns vowel sounds to these letters.
The sound R might seem out of place here, but in many
dialects of English it behaves almost like a vowel: consider
a word like _turn_, where the R-sound dominates and the U hardly
registers.

### The _Quessë_ Variations

The English mode uses two modified versions of the letter _quessë_ ([.t z]):
[.t zê] and [.t z|]. In some Elvish modes, a mark like a flattened S above
a letter indicated a following W; thus the use of [.t zê] for KW (= QU).
The curl below the letter in [.t z|] indicates a following S (it's
meant to be reminiscent of the _tengwa_ for S, [.t 8]); thus [.t z|]
has the sound KS (= X).

### The Other Tengwar

There are, of course, several _tengwar_ that don't fit into
the pattern of Figure 2, including [.t 7] W, [.t j] L, and
[.t 9] H. These must simply be memorized.

## Using _Tehtar_

Essentially, the _tehtar_ are abbreviations for the vowel letters. Instead of writing out the vowel, you can put a _tehta_ over the preceding consonant.

The _tehta_ for [.s A] is three dots or strokes over the consonant letter. Note the different print and cursive variants.

!!example

[.tab NA] [.t.letterform 5#] / [.ti.letterform 5#]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s E] is a long stroke going up and to the right.

!!example

[.tab NE] [.t.letterform 5$] / [.ti.letterform 5$]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s I] is a single dot.

!!example

[.tab NI] [.t.letterform 5%] / [.ti.letterform 5%]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s O] is a stroke that curls downward at the end.

!!example

[.tab NO] [.t.letterform 5^] / [.ti.letterform 5^]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s U] is a stroke that curls upward at the end.

!!example

[.tab NU] [.t.letterform 5&] / [.ti.letterform 5&]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s Y] is a pair of dots.

!!example

[.tab NY] [.t.letterform 5Ô] / [.ti.letterform 5Ô]

/!

Now you can try your hand at deciphering this text:

!!example

[.ti &#93;jj nR 9Cr$ 1Y 2$aT2$ \`i n9C1 1Y 2Y nT3 3F 1Tt$ 3D1 \`i x%r$5 .i Â x#52#je]

/!

## Abbreviating Doubled Letters

Doubled letters (like _tt_ in _letters_) can be represented by adding a horizontal bar under the _lúva_ of the _tengwa_ to be doubled.

TODO: examples

## Abbreviating Consonant Clusters

Consonant clusters beginning with N can be abbreviated by dropping the N-tengwa and adding a tilde or squiggle above the following consonant.

TODO: examples

## Punctuation

Tengwar punctuation is pretty fast-and-loose compared to English. Most of the punctuation marks are groups of dots vertically centered on the _lúvar_ of the text. These dots can either be stacked vertically, lined up horizontally, or clustered. In general, the more dots there are, the longer of a pause they indicate.

Other punctuation marks include the swung dash, the question mark, and the exclamation point.

## Terminology in This Chapter

The Elvish terms here are Quenya, not Sindarin. This is because the _tengwar_ were invented by Fëanor, a Quenya-speaking Elf, and only used for Sindarin much later in Middle-earth's history.

- [.s tengwa] — literally "sign", this refers to a single Elvish letter. The plural, [.s tengwar] "signs", is the word used to refer to the whole writing system.
- [.s tehta] — a mark written above a _tengwa_. When writing English, they represent vowels. The plural is _tehtar_.
- [.s telco] — literally "stem"; the vertical line that forms the backbone of many _tengwar_. The plural is [.s telqui].
- [.s lúva] — literally "bow"; the curved part of _tengwar_ that have a _telco_. The plural is [.s lúvar].
- [.s coronal consonant] — a sound that involves the front of the tongue touching the upper teeth, or the roof of the mouth just behind the upper teeth. Examples include T, TH, D, and N.
- [.s labial consonant] — a sound that involves closing or constricting the lips. Examples: P, F, B, and M.
- [.s velar consonant] — a sound that involves the back of the tongue touching the _velum_, or soft palate, at the back of the mouth.
- [.s palatal consonant] — a sound that involves contact between the tongue and the hard palate, near the middle of the roof of the mouth.
