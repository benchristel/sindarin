The _tengwar_ (Quenya for "signs") were the Elvish script in
widest use during the Third Age. Following their invention
by the elf Fëanor, they were adapted to many languages and
in time became the dominant writing system of Middle-earth.

Even Sauron used _tengwar_ to inscribe the One Ring:

<p class="center text">
[.tai &#187;][.ti AE5,Ex26Yw1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; AE5,ExxwP%1Ej^][.tai &#171;]
</p>
<p class="center text">
[.ti AE5,Ex37zE1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; X#w6Ykt^AT`Bz7qpT1Ej^]
</p>

It is worth noting that the One Ring inscription is not
"in Elvish". Though the letters are of Elvish design, the
language is Sauron's Black Speech.
Transcribed into our Roman alphabet, the Ring inscription goes:

<p class="center text">
<em>
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,<br/>
ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
</em>
</p>

Not sounds that any Elf would want to utter!

This serves to highlight an important point: the _tengwar_ aren't a language; they're a writing system that, much like our own alphabet, can be applied to many different languages. To drive the point home, the first language we're going to learn to write with _tengwar_ will be English.

Tolkien never devised an "official" way of writing English
with _tengwar_. He was mainly interested in how his
languages were used in Middle-earth, and didn't much care
about adapting his writing system to real-world languages.
He did create a few _tengwar_ inscriptions in English,
including a Christmas greeting to one of his readers. One
system used in that inscription was also employed in
the _Lord of the Rings_ films, and is presented here.

Figure 1 shows the main letters with their English
equivalents.

The two _tengwar_ letters corresponding to TH are used for
different sounds: [.t 3] as in _thin_ or _wreath_ and [.t 4] as in
_this_ or _wreathe_.

When you're putting these together into words, make sure the central curly bits (_lúvar_ in Quenya) of the letters all sit on the same line. Here's an example:

!!example

[.t 4\`8 whhz 1ljj8 he 4l jnbynxl8 he 4l ljrl8 n52 9h7 4l~ n6l 8qhzl5 n52 76\`11l5]

/!

And here is the same text in a cursive style:

!!example

[.ti 4\`8 whhz 1ljj8 he 4l jnbynxl8 he 4l ljrl8 n52 9h7 3l~ n6l 8qhzl5 n52 76\`11l5]

/!

Here's a rather silly sentence that uses all the letters. The dots between words are _tengwar_ commas.

!!example

[.t c\`jjnz| = zêh3 4l x6ytq~ o\`1l 7\`,n62 = \`5rhz\`b e\`rl 9nd wn5fh8]

## Structure and Organization of the Tengwar

Many of the _tengwar_ letters seem to be variations on a
theme: one or two loops and a long stem pointing up or down.
This is by design: the _tengwar_ are a partially [.term featural script],
in which the shape of a letter encodes
information about how that letter sounds.
If you learn the system, it will make the _tengwar_ much
easier to learn.

Figure 2 shows the main _tengwar_ in the
arrangement traditionally used by the Elves. In this arrangement, the
patterns of sound and shape become evident.

Each _tengwa_ consists
of a stem, or _telco_, and one or two bows, or _lúvar_.
The stem can be on the left or right, the bows open or closed.
The stem can also extend up or down from the _lúvar_.

### The Four _Témar_

The Elves grouped the _tengwar_ into four _témar_ (Quenya for "series"),
which are represented by the four columns of Figure 2.
Their names are, in order from left to right: _tincotéma_,
_parmatéma_, _calmatéma_, and _quessetéma_. The _témar_ are named
after their first letters [.t 1], [.t q], [.t a], and [.t z],
called _tinco_ "metal", _parma_ "book", _calma_ "lamp", and _quessë_ "feather" in Quenya.
The _tengwar_ of each series have the same stem position
(left or right) and bow type (open or closed).

The _tengwar_ of the _tincotéma_ usually represent sounds made with
the tip of the tongue touching or just behind the upper
teeth. So it is in the English mode: the sounds of T, D, TH, N, and R
share this characteristic.

The _tengwar_ of the _parmatéma_ are usually used for sounds
that involve the lips, as P, B, F, V, M, U.

In Quenya the _calmatéma_ was used for sounds made with
the tongue against the roof of the mouth, as K, NG, NC, and
the _quessetéma_ for the same sounds plus W: QU (KW),
NQU, NGW. In the English mode, the uses of these two _témar_
are a bit jumbled, but you can still find traces of a pattern
if you look hard enough.

### The Six _Tyeller_

The Elves also grouped the _tengwar_ into _tyeller_ or "grades".
These correspond to the six rows of Figure 2.

The first two rows contain hard consonants, or [.term plosives].
These sounds involve stopping the airflow in the mouth and then releasing it with a little pop.
You can recognize a plosive _tengwa_ by its stem, which extends down below the _lúvar_.
The number of _lúvar_ tells you whether the sound is voiced or unvoiced (see the chapter on pronunciation for an explanation of the voiced/unvoiced distinction).

The third and fourth rows contain [.term spirant] consonants, which
draw out the sound into a steady stream of air, creating a hiss or buzz.
As with the plosives, the number of _lúvar_ tells you whether the
sound is voiced or unvoiced.

The fifth row contains [.term nasal] consonants, which as you might
guess require you to redirect air through your nose. In
English, nasals are always voiced, and the doubled _lúvar_
reflect this.

The sixth row contains vowels. It might seem strange that
R is included here, but in English R is practically a vowel.
in a word like _turn_ there's no trace of a U-sound;
we might as well spell it _trrn_. This is the only row where
a single _lúva_ doesn't indicate lack of voicing. Vowels
(and R) are always voiced in English.

### Other Languages and Modes




## Using _Tehtar_

Essentially, the _tehtar_ are abbreviations for the vowel letters. Instead of writing out the vowel, you can put a _tehta_ over the preceding consonant.

The _tehta_ for [.s A] is three dots or strokes over the consonant letter. Note the different print and cursive variants.

!!example

[.tab NA] [.t.letterform 5#] / [.ti.letterform 5#]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s E] is a long stroke going up and to the right.

!!example

[.tab NE] [.t.letterform 5$] / [.ti.letterform 5$]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s I] is a single dot.

!!example

[.tab NI] [.t.letterform 5%] / [.ti.letterform 5%]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s O] is a stroke that curls downward at the end.

!!example

[.tab NO] [.t.letterform 5^] / [.ti.letterform 5^]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s U] is a stroke that curls upward at the end.

!!example

[.tab NU] [.t.letterform 5&] / [.ti.letterform 5&]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s Y] is a pair of dots.

!!example

[.tab NY] [.t.letterform 5Ô] / [.ti.letterform 5Ô]

/!

Now you can try your hand at deciphering this text:

!!example

[.ti &#93;jj nR 9Cr$ 1Y 2$aT2$ \`i n9C1 1Y 2Y nT3 3F 1Tt$ 3D1 \`i x%r$5 .i Â x#52#je]

/!

## Abbreviating Doubled Letters

Doubled letters (like _tt_ in _letters_) can be represented by adding a horizontal bar under the _lúva_ of the _tengwa_ to be doubled.

TODO: examples

## Abbreviating Consonant Clusters

Consonant clusters beginning with N can be abbreviated by dropping the N-tengwa and adding a tilde or squiggle above the following consonant.

TODO: examples

## Punctuation

Tengwar punctuation is pretty fast-and-loose compared to English. Most of the punctuation marks are groups of dots vertically centered on the _lúvar_ of the text. These dots can either be stacked vertically, lined up horizontally, or clustered. In general, the more dots there are, the longer of a pause they indicate.

Other punctuation marks include the swung dash, the question mark, and the exclamation point.

## Terminology in This Chapter

The Elvish terms here are Quenya, not Sindarin. This is because the _tengwar_ were invented by Fëanor, a Quenya-speaking Elf, and only used for Sindarin much later in Middle-earth's history.

- [.s tengwa] — literally "sign", this refers to a single Elvish letter. The plural, [.s tengwar] "signs", is the word used to refer to the whole writing system.
- [.s tehta] — a mark written above a _tengwa_. When writing English, they represent vowels. The plural is _tehtar_.
- [.s telco] — literally "stem"; the vertical line that forms the backbone of many _tengwar_. The plural is [.s telqui].
- [.s lúva] — literally "bow"; the curved part of _tengwar_ that have a _telco_. The plural is [.s lúvar].
- [.s coronal consonant] — a sound that involves the front of the tongue touching the upper teeth, or the roof of the mouth just behind the upper teeth. Examples include T, TH, D, and N.
- [.s labial consonant] — a sound that involves closing or constricting the lips. Examples: P, F, B, and M.
- [.s velar consonant] — a sound that involves the back of the tongue touching the _velum_, or soft palate, at the back of the mouth.
- [.s palatal consonant] — a sound that involves contact between the tongue and the hard palate, near the middle of the roof of the mouth.
