The _tengwar_ (Quenya for "signs") were the Elvish script in
widest use during the Third Age. Following their invention
by the elf Fëanor, they were adapted to many languages and
in time became the dominant writing system of Middle-earth.

Even Sauron used _tengwar_ to inscribe the One Ring:

<p class="center text">
[.tai &#187;][.ti AE5,Ex26Yw1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; AE5,ExxwP%1Ej^][.tai &#171;]
</p>
<p class="center text">
[.ti AE5,Ex37zE1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; X#w6Ykt^AT`Bz7qpT1Ej^]
</p>

It is worth noting that the One Ring inscription is not
"in Elvish". Though the letters are of Elvish design, the
language is Sauron's Black Speech.
Transcribed into our Roman alphabet, the Ring inscription goes:

<p class="center text">
<em>
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,<br/>
ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
</em>
</p>

Not sounds that any Elf would want to utter!

This serves to highlight an important point: the _tengwar_ aren't a language; they're a writing system that, much like our own alphabet, can be applied to many different languages. To drive the point home, the first language we're going to learn to write with _tengwar_ will be English.

Tolkien never devised an "official" way of writing English
with _tengwar_. He was mainly interested in how his
languages were used in Middle-earth, and didn't much care
about adapting his writing system to real-world languages.
He did create a few _tengwar_ inscriptions in English,
including a Christmas greeting to one of his readers. One
system used in that inscription was also employed in
the _Lord of the Rings_ films, and is presented here.

Figure 1 shows the main letters with their English
equivalents.

The two _tengwar_ letters corresponding to TH are used for
different sounds: [.t 3] as in _thin_ or _wreath_ and [.t 4] as in
_this_ or _wreathe_.

When you're putting these together into words, make sure the central curly bits (_lúvar_ in Quenya) of the letters all sit on the same line. Here's an example:

!!example

[.t 4\`8 whhz 1ljj8 he 4l jnbynxl8 he 4l ljrl8 n52 9h7 4l~ n6l 8qhzl5 n52 76\`11l5]

/!

And here is the same text in a cursive style:

!!example

[.ti 4\`8 whhz 1ljj8 he 4l jnbynxl8 he 4l ljrl8 n52 9h7 3l~ n6l 8qhzl5 n52 76\`11l5]

/!

Here's a rather silly sentence that uses all the letters. The dots between words are _tengwar_ commas.

!!example

[.t c\`jjnz| = zêh3 4l x6ytq~ o\`1l 7\`,n62 = \`5rhz\`b e\`rl 9nd wn5fh8]

You may find Figure 2 helpful in deciphering these texts.
It shows all the _tengwar_ in their traditional arrangement,
which groups them by shape. Some _tengwar_, like the signs
for I ([.t \`]) and Y ([.t ~]) are not part of the traditional
presentation of the _tengwar_ and are left out. Also, many of
the _tengwar_ aren't assigned an English letter. These
_tengwar_ do have meaning in other modes, including the ones for
writing Sindarin.

In most _tengwar_ modes, the shape of a letter tells you
something about its sound. For instance, the letters that
have a "stem" on the left and a curved "bow" that is open on the bottom,
like [.t 1], [.t 2], [.t 4], etc. all represent sounds made
with the tongue touching or just behind the upper teeth.
Letters that are closed off on the bottom, like [.t q],
[.t w], [.t t], etc. are sounds that require you to close
your lips. These patterns make _tengwar_-writing a little
easier to learn.

If you're satisfied with being able to read that, you can skip to the next chapter. You'll notice though, that the example above has none of the dots and curls (_tehtar_ in Quenya) above the letters that make the ring inscription so cool-looking. If you want to add some flair to your _tengwar_ writing, read on to learn how _tehtar_ work.

## Using _Tehtar_

Essentially, the _tehtar_ are abbreviations for the vowel letters. Instead of writing out the vowel, you can put a _tehta_ over the preceding consonant.

The _tehta_ for [.s A] is three dots or strokes over the consonant letter. Note the different print and cursive variants.

!!example

[.tab NA] [.t.letterform 5#] / [.ti.letterform 5#]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s E] is a long stroke going up and to the right.

!!example

[.tab NE] [.t.letterform 5$] / [.ti.letterform 5$]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s I] is a single dot.

!!example

[.tab NI] [.t.letterform 5%] / [.ti.letterform 5%]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s O] is a stroke that curls downward at the end.

!!example

[.tab NO] [.t.letterform 5^] / [.ti.letterform 5^]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s U] is a stroke that curls upward at the end.

!!example

[.tab NU] [.t.letterform 5&] / [.ti.letterform 5&]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s Y] is a pair of dots.

!!example

[.tab NY] [.t.letterform 5Ô] / [.ti.letterform 5Ô]

/!

Now you can try your hand at deciphering this text:

!!example

[.ti &#93;jj nR 9Cr$ 1Y 2$aT2$ \`i n9C1 1Y 2Y nT3 3F 1Tt$ 3D1 \`i x%r$5 .i Â x#52#je]

## The Organization of the _Tengwar_

Did you find yourself flipping back to the _tengwar_ chart while trying to read that text? Reading _tengwar_ can get extremely confusing since most of the letters look very similar to one another. However, there's a regular system underlying the _tengwar_, and knowing it will make them much easier to read and write.

What happens if we arrange the _tengwar_ by their shape?

Note that the _tengwar_ in each column have curly bits (_lúvar_) that go the same direction and are all either open or closed off with a bar. The tengwar in each row have the same number of _lúvar_, and their _telqui_ or "stems" point in the same direction—either up or down.

Now the interesting part: by grouping the _tengwar_ by shape, we've actually grouped them by sound as well.

In the top two rows are the hard consonants or _plosives_—sounds made by stopping the airflow in the mouth and then releasing it with a pop. These letters all have a downward stem (or _telco_). You'll notice that the letters are also grouped by whether they have one or two _lúvar_. A single _lúva_ means the sound is pronounced without the vocal cords vibrating—in linguistic terms, it's _unvoiced_. Doubling the _lúva_ makes the _voiced_ version of the sound—pronounced with vocal cord vibration.

If that's all too abstract, try holding a finger against your Adam's apple and pronouncing a drawn-out "S". Now make it a "Z". Did you feel the vibration kick in? That's voicing.

On to the third and fourth rows, where the _telqui_ point up instead of down. The upward-pointing _telqui_ draw out the sounds into _spirants_—hisses or buzzes. Again, the single-_lúva_ letters represent unvoiced sounds; doubling the _lúva_ adds voicing.

The letters in the fifth row are _nasals_ (sounds that redirect air through the nose). These are all voiced, hence the double _lúvar_.

If we look at the _columns_ of the table, a complementary pattern emerges. The first column has all the _coronal_ consonants, which use the tip of the tongue to stop the airflow. The second column is all _labial_ consonants, which involve the lips. And the third and fourth columns are _palatal_ and _velar_ consonants, in which the back of the tongue rises to the roof of the mouth.

What about the gaps in the table, the _tengwar_ with no corresponding English letter? Although these _tengwar_ aren't used for English, they are used for other languages, including Sindarin and Quenya.

## Abbreviating Doubled Letters

Doubled letters (like _tt_ in _letters_) can be represented by adding a horizontal bar under the _lúva_ of the _tengwa_ to be doubled.

TODO: examples

## Abbreviating Consonant Clusters

Consonant clusters beginning with N can be abbreviated by dropping the N-tengwa and adding a tilde or squiggle above the following consonant.

TODO: examples

## Punctuation

Tengwar punctuation is pretty fast-and-loose compared to English. Most of the punctuation marks are groups of dots vertically centered on the _lúvar_ of the text. These dots can either be stacked vertically, lined up horizontally, or clustered. In general, the more dots there are, the longer of a pause they indicate.

Other punctuation marks include the swung dash, the question mark, and the exclamation point.

## Terminology in This Chapter

The Elvish terms here are Quenya, not Sindarin. This is because the _tengwar_ were invented by Fëanor, a Quenya-speaking Elf, and only used for Sindarin much later in Middle-earth's history.

- [.s tengwa] — literally "sign", this refers to a single Elvish letter. The plural, [.s tengwar] "signs", is the word used to refer to the whole writing system.
- [.s tehta] — a mark written above a _tengwa_. When writing English, they represent vowels. The plural is _tehtar_.
- [.s telco] — literally "stem"; the vertical line that forms the backbone of many _tengwar_. The plural is [.s telqui].
- [.s lúva] — literally "bow"; the curved part of _tengwar_ that have a _telco_. The plural is [.s lúvar].
- [.s coronal consonant] — a sound that involves the front of the tongue touching the upper teeth, or the roof of the mouth just behind the upper teeth. Examples include T, TH, D, and N.
- [.s labial consonant] — a sound that involves closing or constricting the lips. Examples: P, F, B, and M.
- [.s velar consonant] — a sound that involves the back of the tongue touching the _velum_, or soft palate, at the back of the mouth.
- [.s palatal consonant] — a sound that involves contact between the tongue and the hard palate, near the middle of the roof of the mouth.
