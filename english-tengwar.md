Tolkien's _tengwar_ script is instantly recognizable—nothing evokes "elvish" like a snippet of _tengwar_ text. It's easy to understand why the _tengwar_ are popular—you don't have to be a Tolkien buff or a language geek to be struck by their beauty.

That's the One Ring inscription, probably the most famous example of the Elvish script. But if you get it tattooed around your arm and claim that it's in an Elvish *language*, the joke's on you—it's actually Sauron's Black Speech, written with _tengwar_ letters. Transcribed into our Roman alphabet, the Ring inscription goes:

<p class="center text">
<em>
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,<br/>
ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
</em>
</p>

Not sounds that any Elf would want to utter!

This serves to highlight an important point: the _tengwar_ aren't a language; they're a writing system that, much like our own alphabet, can be applied to many different languages. To further drive the point home, the first language we're going to learn to write with _tengwar_ will be English.

The Moria gate inscription was in Sindarin. The tengwar read: [.s Ennyn Durin Aran Moria: pedo mellon a minno. Im Narvi hain echant: Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thiw hin.] "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter. I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs."

Why start with English, since most of this book is about Sindarin? The main reason is that if you're reading this book front-to-back, you don't yet know any Sindarin words, so learning how to write Sindarin in _tengwar_ at this stage is not very useful. Additionally, the _tengwar_ are very different from our alphabet, not just in their shapes but in the way the whole writing system is organized, and learning how those differences apply to a familiar language like English will be much easier than trying to figure them out in a language you don't know yet. And finally, if you want to introduce your friends to _tengwar_-writing, they probably won't have the patience to learn Sindarin, but they might be interested in having a secret code to write English.

There is no "official" way of writing English with Sindarin, because as far as we know, Tolkien never wrote down instructions for how to do it. He was mainly interested in how his languages were used in Middle-earth, and didn't much care about adapting his writing system to real-world languages. He did create a _tengwar_ inscription in English for the title page of _The Lord of the Rings_, using a system that attempted to hybridize sound-based spelling and straightforward letter-for-letter transcription.

While this transcription is interesting in its own right (and I highly encourage you to go puzzle it out after reading this chapter!) I don't think the spelling system it uses can be learned or used with any confidence. Using it requires constantly making choices: do I represent that silent letter in the _tengwar_? What vowel-mark should I use for the _e_ in _roses_? What about words that are pronounced differently in different dialects?

All of these problems go away if you simply choose a _tengwar_ letter to represent each English letter, and leave it at that. That is the approach taken in this chapter.

What follows is one possible system for writing English with _tengwar_. It has the advantage that, once learned, it is fairly simple, yet it is difficult for anyone who doesn't know it to crack the code. It's also well-suited to calligraphy; with a little practice you'll be able to make some pretty awesome Ring-inscription-style lettering.

Here are the main letters with their English equivalents:

When you're putting these together into words, make sure the central curly bits (_lúvar_ in Quenya) of the letters all sit on the same line. Here's an example:

!!example

[.t 3\`i whhz 1ljji he 3l j&#93;b.&#93;xli he 3l ljrli &#93;52 9hn 3l~ &#93;7l iqhzl5 &#93;52 n7\`11l5]

/!

And here is the same text in a cursive style:

!!example

[.ti 3\`i whhz 1ljji he 3l j&#93;b.&#93;xli he 3l ljrli &#93;52 9hn 3l~ &#93;7l iqhzl5 &#93;52 n7\`11l5]

/!

If you're satisfied with being able to read that, you can skip to the next chapter. You'll notice though, that the example above has none of the dots and curls (_tehtar_ in Quenya) above the letters that make the ring inscription so cool-looking. If you want to add some flair to your _tengwar_ writing, read on to learn how _tehtar_ work.

## Using _Tehtar_

Essentially, the _tehtar_ are abbreviations for the vowel letters. Instead of writing out the vowel, you can put a _tehta_ over the preceding consonant.

The _tehta_ for [.s A] is three dots or strokes over the consonant letter. Note the different print and cursive variants.

!!example

[.tab NA] [.t.letterform 5#] / [.ti.letterform 5#]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s E] is a long stroke going up and to the right.

!!example

[.tab NE] [.t.letterform 5$] / [.ti.letterform 5$]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s I] is a single dot.

!!example

[.tab NI] [.t.letterform 5%] / [.ti.letterform 5%]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s O] is a stroke that curls downward at the end.

!!example

[.tab NO] [.t.letterform 5^] / [.ti.letterform 5^]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s U] is a stroke that curls upward at the end.

!!example

[.tab NU] [.t.letterform 5&] / [.ti.letterform 5&]

/!

The _tehta_ for [.s Y] is a pair of dots.

!!example

[.tab NY] [.t.letterform 5Ô] / [.ti.letterform 5Ô]

/!

Now you can try your hand at deciphering this text:

!!example

[.ti &#93;jj nR 9Cr$ 1Y 2$aT2$ \`i n9C1 1Y 2Y nT3 3F 1Tt$ 3D1 \`i x%r$5 .i Â x#52#je]

## The Organization of the _Tengwar_

Did you find yourself flipping back to the _tengwar_ chart while trying to read that text? Reading _tengwar_ can get extremely confusing since most of the letters look very similar to one another. However, there's a regular system underlying the _tengwar_, and knowing it will make them much easier to read and write.

What happens if we arrange the _tengwar_ by their shape?

<table class="col-4 columns">
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>[.tab T][.t.letterform 1]</li>
<li>[.tab D][.t.letterform 2]</li>
<li>[.tab TH][.t.letterform 3]</li>
<li>[.tab  ][.t.letterform 4]</li>

<li>[.tab NG][.t.letterform b]</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Note that the _tengwar_ in each column have curly bits (_lúvar_) that go the same direction and are all either open or closed off with a bar. The tengwar in each row have the same number of _lúvar_, and their _telqui_ or "stems" point in the same direction—either up or down.

Now the interesting part: by grouping the _tengwar_ by shape, we've actually grouped them by sound as well.

In the top two rows are the hard consonants or _plosives_—sounds made by stopping the airflow in the mouth and then releasing it with a pop. These letters all have a downward stem (or _telco_). You'll notice that the letters are also grouped by whether they have one or two _lúvar_. A single _lúva_ means the sound is pronounced without the vocal cords vibrating—in linguistic terms, it's _unvoiced_. Doubling the _lúva_ makes the _voiced_ version of the sound—pronounced with vocal cord vibration.

If that's all too abstract, try holding a finger against your Adam's apple and pronouncing a drawn-out "S". Now make it a "Z". Did you feel the vibration kick in? That's voicing.

On to the third and fourth rows, where the _telqui_ point up instead of down. The upward-pointing _telqui_ draw out the sounds into _spirants_—hisses or buzzes. Again, the single-_lúva_ letters represent unvoiced sounds; doubling the _lúva_ adds voicing.

The letters in the fifth row are _nasals_ (sounds that redirect air through the nose). These are all voiced, hence the double _lúvar_.

If we look at the _columns_ of the table, a complementary pattern emerges. The first column has all the _coronal_ consonants, which use the tip of the tongue to stop the airflow. The second column is all _labial_ consonants, which involve the lips. And the third and fourth columns are _palatal_ and _velar_ consonants, in which the back of the tongue rises to the roof of the mouth.

What about the gaps in the table, the _tengwar_ with no corresponding English letter? Although these _tengwar_ aren't used for English, they are used for other languages, including Sindarin and Quenya.

## Abbreviating Doubled Letters

Doubled letters (like _tt_ in _letters_) can be represented by adding a horizontal bar under the _lúva_ of the _tengwa_ to be doubled.

TODO: examples

## Abbreviating Consonant Clusters

Consonant clusters beginning with N can be abbreviated by dropping the N-tengwa and adding a tilde or squiggle above the following consonant.

TODO: examples

## Punctuation

Tengwar punctuation is pretty fast-and-loose compared to English. Most of the punctuation marks are groups of dots vertically centered on the _lúvar_ of the text. These dots can either be stacked vertically, lined up horizontally, or clustered. In general, the more dots there are, the longer of a pause they indicate.

Other punctuation marks include the swung dash, the question mark, and the exclamation point.

    <td><p>[.t 1 - 1]</p><p>colon, longer pause</p></td>

## Terminology in This Chapter

The Elvish terms here are Quenya, not Sindarin. This is because the _tengwar_ were invented by Fëanor, a Quenya-speaking Elf, and only used for Sindarin much later in Middle-earth's history.

- [.s tengwa] — literally "sign", this refers to a single Elvish letter. The plural, [.s tengwar] "signs", is the word used to refer to the whole writing system.
- [.s tehta] — a mark written above a _tengwa_. When writing English, they represent vowels. The plural is _tehtar_.
- [.s telco] — literally "stem"; the vertical line that forms the backbone of many _tengwar_. The plural is [.s telqui].
- [.s lúva] — literally "bow"; the curved part of _tengwar_ that have a _telco_. The plural is [.s lúvar].
- [.s coronal consonant] — a sound that involves the front of the tongue touching the upper teeth, or the roof of the mouth just behind the upper teeth. Examples include T, TH, D, and N.
- [.s labial consonant] — a sound that involves closing or constricting the lips. Examples: P, F, B, and M.
- [.s velar consonant] — a sound that involves the back of the tongue touching the _velum_, or soft palate, at the back of the mouth.
- [.s palatal consonant] — a sound that involves contact between the tongue and the hard palate, near the middle of the roof of the mouth.
