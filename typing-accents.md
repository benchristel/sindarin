# Typing Accented Characters

## On Mac OSX

On a Mac, you can type vowels with an acute accent by pressing `option`+`E` and then typing the vowel that you want. To type a circumflex, use `option`+`I` instead.

## On Windows

Typing special characters on Windows is considerably more annoying. The best way is probably to change your keyboard settings to international mode, which will let you type accented letters using key combinations. A guide to doing that can be found [here](http://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/accents/codeint.html). Alternatively, you can copy and paste the accented letters from the table below.

<div style="text-align:center;font-size:24px">
á é í ó ú ý â ê î ô û ŷ<br/>
Á É Í Ó Ú Ý Â Ê Î Ô Û Ŷ
</div>
