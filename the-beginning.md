[.s Mae govannen!] ~ "Well met!"

/!

[.s Mae] "well" is pronounced a bit like "my". The vowels [.s a e i o u] are pronounced more or less as in Spanish or Italian: ah, eh, ee, oh, oo. [.s Govannen] "met" is stressed on the second-to-last syllable: go-VAN-nen.

!!example

[.s Él síla na lû govaded vín] ~ "A star shines on the hour of our meeting"

/!

The accent marks indicate that the vowel is held a bit longer than the vowels without an accent. [.s Govaded] "meeting" is stressed on the third-to-last syllable: GO-va-ded.

[.s Pedich edhellen?] ~ "Do you speak Elvish?"

/!

The [.s ch] in Sindarin is the slightly raspy sound heard in German _Bach_ or Scottish _loch_. It's not pronounced as far back in the throat though. Try saying an H but raise your tongue toward the roof of your mouth as if you were going to pronounce K.

The [.s dh] in [.s edhellen] is like the TH of "then" or "this". Note that it's different from the sound of "thin", which is spelled [.s th] in Sindarin. If you find this difference hard to hear, you can think of [.s dh] as "Z with a lisp".

[.s Edhellen] is stressed on the second-to-last syllable: eh-THEL-len.

[.s Man i eneth lín?] ~ "What is your name?"

[.s Ce no mellyn?] ~ "Can we be friends?"

/!

The letter C in Sindarin is always pronounced like a K. The letter Y sounds like the ü in German über or the u in French lune: it's like an "ee" sound but with your lips rounded as if you were saying "oo". If you find this too hard, you can just say "ee" for Y—that's what the Gondorians did when speaking Sindarin, since their native language, Westron, didn't have the Y sound.
