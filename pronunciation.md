It's hard to learn pronunciation from a book—an audio recording is worth a thousand words of print. This chapter will give you the basics, but you should also check out the online resources. These include recordings of Tolkien pronouncing Sindarin words from _The Lord of the Rings_—naturally the ultimate source for learning to say them correctly yourself. You can find a list of links at menegroth.github.io/links.html.

Of course, the truly authoritative source for Sindarin pronunciation is Appendix E of _The Lord of the Rings_, upon which much of the material here is based.

## The Sounds of Sindarin

Tolkien's languages have many imitators in fantasy literature, probably because they balance nicely between familiar and exotic. If you pronounce Sindarin like Latin or Greek you won't be far off. Still, Tolkien uses some sounds and spellings that differ enough from English to deserve mention, and these are discussed in detail below. The good news is that Sindarin's spelling is _phonetic_, so if you know how a word is pronounced, you can figure out how to spell it with 100% accuracy.

### Consonants

[.term Consonants] are the sounds of language that involve blocking the air flowing through your mouth, creating popping, hissing, or buzzing sounds. This is in contrast to [.term vowels], which allow air to flow freely. In English, we're used to thinking of all letters except A, E, I, O, and U as consonants.

Most Sindarin consonants are pronounced as you'd expect. There are a few sounds with unintuitive spellings, though, and Sindarin even has some sounds that don't occur in English at all. The sounds and spellings that deviate from English are described below.

- [.s C] and [.s G] are always hard, as in _cat_ and _get_. [.s Celeborn] is pronounced "Keleborn".
- [.s CH] is the sound in German _Bach_. If this sound gives you trouble, you could pronounce it [.s H] or [.s K], as the Gondorians did. In the Gondor dialect the place-name [.s Rochann] was pronounced [.s Rohan]—hence the spelling used in _LotR_.
- [.s R] is tapped or trilled, as in Spanish.
- [.s TH] and [.s DH] are the sounds of _thin_ and _this_, respectively. The difference is that when you say _this_ your vocal cords are vibrating—put a finger on your throat and you can feel the difference.
- [.s LH] and [.s RH] are like [.s L] and [.s R] pronounced [.term voicelessly]—that is, with no vocal cord vibration. These sounds are lifted straight from Welsh, where they're spelled _LL_ and _RH_: _Llewellyn_, _Rhiannon_.
- [.s HW] is similarly a voiceless version of [.s W]. This is the WH-sound in _whale_, in varieties of English that pronounce it differently from _wail_.
- [.s S] is *always* voiceless—it never has a Z-sound, even at the end of a word. The last syllable of [.s Fanuilos] "Everwhite" sounds like _loss_.
- [.s NG], between vowels, is pronounced with a hard [.s G] as in _finger_. elsewhere, it's pronounced as in _ring_.

### Vowels

The vowel letters A, E, I, O, and U correspond one-to-one with the vowel sounds "ah", "eh", "ee", "oh", "oo". Tolkien was aiming for familiarity here: Spanish, Italian, and many other languages have similar vowel systems.

Even English, for all its crazy spelling, sometimes uses the five vowels with their Sindarin pronunciations:

- [.s A]: &ldquo;f[.hi a]ther&rdquo;
- [.s E]: &ldquo;w[.hi e]ll&rdquo;
- [.s I]: &ldquo;mach[.hi i]ne&rdquo;
- [.s O]: &ldquo;f[.hi o]r&rdquo;
- [.s U]: &ldquo;br[.hi u]te&rdquo;

With those examples in mind, try pronouncing these words:

- [.s ungol] "spider"
- [.s lembas] "waybread"
- [.s Legolas] "Greenleaf"
- [.s Osgiliath] "Citadel of the Stars"

In addition to the five main vowels, Sindarin has a sixth vowel [.s Y] with no equivalent in English. It's the sound of _u_ in French _lune_, or _ü_ in German _über_. To pronounce it, say "ee" but with your lips rounded as if saying "oo".

If those instructions sound nonsensical, it's because "ee" usually stretches your lips into a smile, basically the opposite of "oo". (That's why people say "cheese" for photos!) However, the other important feature of "ee" is that your tongue is pushed forward when saying it, nearly touching your upper teeth. So combine that tongue position with lip-rounding and you have the Sindarin [.s Y] sound.

In Gondor, [.s Y] was often pronounced the same as [.s I]—the Gondorians found this sound as troublesome as we do.

### Accents and Vowel Length

An acute accent ([.s á é í ó ú ý]) indicates that the vowel is held for a slightly longer duration. So in a word like [.s míriel] "sparkling like jewels", the first syllable [.s mí] is held about twice as long as the second syllable [.s ri].

A circumflex ([.s â ê î ô û ŷ]) also indicates a long vowel, but is mostly used in words of one syllable. This may just be an aesthetic whim of Tolkien's, though he justified it by saying that vowels with the circumflex should be held _even longer_. However, the Elvish writing systems only distinguish two vowel lengths, long and short, so the Elves must not have considered this detail very important.

### Diphthongs

A diphthong (pronounced [.pron DIFF-thong], from the Greek for "two sounds") is a combination of two vowel sounds that blur together into a single syllable. Diphthongs appear frequently in English, like the "ou" in "house" that starts with an "ah" sound and ends with an "oo" sound. Sindarin has a similar diphthong, spelled [.s au].

Here is the complete list of Sindarin diphthongs:

* [.s AI]: as in &ldquo;[.hi ai]sle&rdquo;
* [.s AE]: no English equivalent. [.s AE] is a glide from an [.s A] into an [.s E]. The resulting sound should be similar to [.s AI]; Tolkien even suggested pronouncing [.s AE] the same as [.s AI] if you're not picky. Or you could aim for a Mirkwood accent and pronounce it like [.s E]: compare Mirkwood [.s Legolas] to Classical Sindarin [.s Laegolas].
* [.s AU]: like _ou_ in &ldquo;h[.hi ou]se&rdquo;.
* [.s EI]: as in &ldquo;w[.hi ei]gh&rdquo;
* [.s OE]: like _oy_ in &ldquo;b[.hi oy]&rdquo;, but ending in an "eh" sound.
* [.s UI]: as in _ruin_, but ending in an "ee" sound rather than the "ih" sound. Tolkien noted that this was a "long diphthong" and scanned as two syllables in poetry: hence [.s Fanuilos, le linnathon] in the Hymn to Elbereth, where the meter requires eight syllables per line.

## Special Cases

### At the end of a word:

* [.s V]: The [.s V]-sound is spelled [.s F] at the end of a word: [.s nef] "on this side of" is pronounced as _nev_ in _never_. When the [.s F]-sound occurs at the end of a word, it's spelled [.s PH], as in [.s alph] "swan". This quirk of spelling probably hearkens back to Tolkien's fondness for Welsh, where _F_ has a V-sound.
* [.s AU] is spelled [.s AW] word-finally: [.s caw] "top" sounds very similar to _cow_.
* [.s W] can occur word-finally, which can be troublesome for English-speakers. To pronounce [.s têw] "letter", try saying "teh win" but stop at the _w_. In any case, [.s têw] should never be pronounced as if it rhymes with _new_.

### At the beginning of a word

* [.s IA], [.s IAU], [.s IE], [.s IO], [.s IUI]: When these combinations appear word-initially, the [.s I] sounds like the _y_ in _yes_. So [.s ionnath] "sons" and [.s Ioreth] "Old Woman" begin with a _yo_ sound.
* [.s ND], [.s MB], [.s NG]: These clusters can occur at the beginning of a word. Pronouncing these sounds is arguably the most challenging aspect of Sindarin pronunciation for English speakers, though it can certainly be mastered with practice. You may be happy to know that these word-initial clusters only arise due to mutations and therefore almost always follow a vowel, as in [.s i mbair] "the lands". This makes things somewhat easier; if you say _im bair_ probably no one will notice.

To complicate matters, the spelling [.s NG] is actually ambiguous at the beginning of a word. Sometimes it represents a single, unitary sound, the _ng_ in _ring_, while at other times it represents that sound plus _g_, as in _finger_. Each sound arises from a different type of mutation. At this point, you don't have to worry about the distinction—pronouncing either of these sounds correctly is hard enough for a first lesson!

## Long Consonants

In addition to having long and short vowels, Sindarin makes a contrast between long and short consonants. English also has this contrast in a few cases: _unaimed_ has a short _n_, while _unnamed_ (if you're trying to pronounce it differently from _unaimed_) has a long _n_.

In Sindarin spelling, a doubled letter means the consonant is long. For example, [.s.salo melon] "I love" has a short [.s L], while [.s mellon] "friend" has a long [.s L].

[.s PH] is a tricky exception: at the beginning or end of a word it's a short [.s F]-sound, pronounced as in _photograph_. However, in the middle of a word, it's long: [.s ephel] "outer fence" is pronounced _ef-fel_.

## <a name="splitting-up-letter-combinations">Spelling Ambiguities</a>

The modern English alphabet simply doesn't have enough letters to represent Sindarin unambiguously. In compound words especially, confusion can arise.

The combinations [.s DH], [.s LH], [.s RH], [.s TH] sometimes represent a sequence of two distinct sounds, e.g. [.s T]+[.s H]. For example, [.s Panthael] ("Fullwise", a name given to Sam Gamgee by Aragorn), is a compound [.s pant+hael], so the [.s t] and [.s h] are pronounced separately, as in _anthill_, not as in _anthem_. Similarly, [.s Edhelharn] "Elfstone", is a compound [.s edhel+harn].

So how do you know when to pronounce the letter-sequence "th" as [.s T]+[.s H], and when to pronounce it as a single sound? The answer, unfortunately, is that you just have to memorize the (rare) cases where "th" represents [.s T]+[.s H].

It's worth noting that the sounds [.s LH] and [.s RH] can't occur in the middle of a word, so if you see a word like [.s Edhelharn] or [.s Perhael] "Halfwise", you know that the [.s H] should be a separate sound.

The Elvish writing system _tengwar_ doesn't have this ambiguity, because the sounds [.s DH], [.s LH], [.s RH], [.s TH] each have their own symbol. So recognizing letter combinations that should be split up isn't just relevant for pronunciation—you need to know this to write in tengwar, as well!

## Stress

Sindarin, like English, puts emphasis or _stress_ on one syllable of multi-syllable words. In English, stress can alter the meaning of a word, as in the following:

> Sam received a **present** from Galadriel.
> We have to **present** our project to the class.

With the first syllable stressed, &ldquo;[.hi pre]sent&rdquo; is a noun. Stress the second syllable, &ldquo;pre[.hi sent]&rdquo;, and it becomes a verb.

In Sindarin, the stress of a word can't change its meaning, but it's vital to learn how words are stressed in order to write poetry. If you pronounce words with the wrong stress, you'll just sound weird.

Fortunately, Sindarin stress is predicatable from the shape of the word, so you don't have to memorize where the stress falls for each word individually. This section describes how to figure out which syllable is stressed.

### Syllables

Before you can place the stress in a word, you have to break it down into syllables. Many people find this difficult at first, but there's a trick to it: look at the vowels.

Each syllable has exactly one vowel or diphthong at its core—no more, no less. So [.s Elbereth Gilthoniel] breaks down as [.s El&middot;be&middot;reth Gil&middot;tho&middot;ni&middot;el]. [.s Thranduil] has only two syllables, [.s Thran&middot;duil], because [.s ui] is a diphthong.

### Stress in Two-Syllable Words

Tolkien states in Appendix E that "[i]n words of two syllables, [the stress] falls in practically all cases on the first syllable". Thus we have [.s <span class="hi">Per</span>&middot;hael] "Samwise", [.s <span class="hi">El</span>&middot;rond].

### Stress in Longer Words

The general rule for longer words is to stress the third-to-last syllable: [.s <span class="hi">El</span>&middot;be&middot;reth], [.s Gil&middot;<span class="hi">tho</span>&middot;ni&middot;el], [.s <span class="hi">Le</span>&middot;go&middot;las]

However, the second-to-last syllable gets the stress if its vowel is:

- long (accented), as [.s í] in [.s Celeb<span class="hi">rí</span>an] ("Silver-queen", Arwen's mother)
- a diphthong, as [.s ae] in [.s Hi<span class="hi">thaeg</span>lir] ("the Misty Mountains")
- or followed by multiple consonants: [.s Cele<span class="hi">brim</span>bor] ("Silver-fist")

Note that in the last case it's consonant *sounds*, not letters, that are important. [.s TH], [.s DH], etc. are single sounds even though they're represented by two letters, so the [.s th] in [.s <span class="hi">Nim</span>brethil] doesn't cause the stress to move.

### Possible Exceptions to the Stress Rule

There are some Sindarin names that don't seem to follow the stress rules in Appendix E, among them [.s Imladris] (Rivendell) and [.s Nargothrond]. These "should" be stressed [.s Im<span class="hi">lad</span>ris], [.s Nar<span class="hi">goth</span>rond], because the second-to-last syllable of each is followed by two consonants. However, we can observe that both are stressed on the first syllable in poetry. This issue is covered in depth <a class="pageref" href="#irregular-stress"></a>.
