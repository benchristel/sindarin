The best way to start learning Sindarin is to just learn some phrases and get a feel for how the language sounds. If you look for patterns in the phrases that follow, you can pick up few useful words, and you might learn a bit of grammar too!

Of course, as you're sounding out these phrases it helps to know how they're supposed to be pronounced. If you pronounce the vowels [.s a e i o u] as in Spanish or Italian you won't go far wrong. The letter [.s y] sounds like _ee_ but with your lips tight as if saying _oo_. Sindarin [.s ch] is like the sound in Scottish _loch_.
