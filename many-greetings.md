If you find yourself among elvenfolk, you will probably want
to start your conversations with the basics: "hello", "goodbye",
"please", and "thank you". This chapter will teach you the
rudiments of conversation.

## Saying Hello

[.s Mae govannen] "[You are] well met" is a common informal greeting.
This phrase is a contracted version of [.s Mae ci govannen],
[.s ci] being an informal, affectionate way of saying "you".
Because of this, [.s Mae govannen] is best reserved for
people you already know well. For more formal situations,
such as greeting someone you're not yet close to, you
might try substituting the formal pronoun [.s le]:
[.s Mae le govannen].

[.s Suilad], meaning simply "greeting", is an all-purpose
way of saying hello. It's not known for certain whether words
of this form can be pluralized, but in movie-Sindarin they
can: [.s.salo suilaid] means "greetings". This opens the
door to more effusive variants like [.s.salo rim suilaid]
"many greetings", or [.s.salo meneg suilaid] "a thousand greetings".
Other variants include [.s le suilon] "I greet you", and
the more formal [.s le suilannon] "I give you greeting".

If you're aiming for a formal greeting with a little flourish,
you can say [.s Êl síla na lû govaned 'wín] "A star shines on the hour of our meeting".

## Introductions

To tell someone your name, just fill in the blank:

!!example

[.s _____ i eneth nín] "My name is _____".

/!

You can also turn this around into a question to ask someone
for their name:

!!example

[.s Man i eneth lín?] "What is your name?"

/!

Another good way of introducing yourself is
[.s _____ estar nin] "They call me _____".

People will probably be able to tell that you're not a
native Sindarin speaker, so as part of introducing yourself
you can tell them where you're from:
[.s _____ i mar nín] "My home is _____".

## Elvish Names

In order to properly introduce yourself in Sindarin, you'll
need an Elvish name. Choose your name with care. Sindarin
names almost always mean something, and in Elvish tradition
names were chosen or bestowed based on the person's
character, achievements, or personal qualities. Because of
this, your chosen name will affect people's first impression
of you.

A comprehensive list of Sindarin names and their meanings
is beyond the scope of this chapter, but a web search for
"Sindarin name list" will turn up good resources.

## Saying Goodbye

Elaborate leave-takings seem to have been a fairly universal
custom in Middle-earth. As such, Sindarin has many ways to
wish people well when you part.

The simplest farewell is perhaps [.s novaer], meaning
"be good", as in "be in good health". [.s Cuio vae] "live well"
expresses a similar sentiment.

If the other party is leaving your meeting-place and you're
staying (for instance, if they were visiting you at your house),
you can wish them well on their travels:

!!example

[.s Calo Anor na ven lín] "May the sun shine on your road"

/!

If you're leaving and the other party is staying, you'll
have to wish them well in a different way:

!!example

[.s No galu na mar lín] "May good fortune be upon your house"

[.s No i Mbelain na le] "May the Valar be with you"

/!

Such phrases, oft repeated, would probably have become abbreviated.
An Elf leaving the house of a friend might utter a simple
[.s.salo Belain na le] "Valar [be] with you".

For a more casual way of saying goodbye, you could try these:

!!example

[.s N'adovaned] "Until we meet again"

[.s N'adgened] "Until I see you again"

/!

## Please and Thank You

[.s ci athol] "If you are willing"

[.s.salo ci athach] "If you are willing"

[.s Le nallon!] "I beg you!" (lit. "I cry to you")

[.s annin] "for me"

[.s.salo Le hannon] "I thank you"

[.s.salo Hennaid] "Thanks"

[.s Le fael] "You are generous"

## Apologies

[.s Díheno nin!] "Forgive me!"

[.s Goheno nin!] "Forgive me!"
