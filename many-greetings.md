If you find yourself among elvenfolk, you will probably want
to start your conversations with the basics: "hello", "goodbye",
"please", and "thank you". This chapter will teach you the
rudiments of conversation.

## Saying Hello

[.s Mae govannen] "[You are] well met" is a common informal greeting.
This phrase is a contracted version of [.s Mae ci govannen],
[.s ci] being an informal, affectionate way of saying "you".
Because of this, [.s Mae govannen] is best reserved for
people you already know well. For more formal situations,
such as greeting someone you're not yet close to, you
might try substituting the formal pronoun [.s le]:
[.s Mae le govannen].

[.s Suilad], meaning simply "greeting", is an all-purpose
way of saying hello. It's not known for certain whether words
of this form can be pluralized, but in movie-Sindarin they
can: [.s.salo suilaid] means "greetings". This opens the
door to more effusive variants like [.s.salo rim suilaid]
"many greetings", or [.s.salo meneg suilaid] "a thousand greetings".
Other variants include [.s le suilon] "I greet you", and
the more formal [.s le suilannon] "I give you greeting".

If you're aiming for a formal greeting with a little flourish,
you can say [.s Êl síla na lû govaned 'wín] "A star shines on the hour of our meeting".

## Introductions

To tell someone your name, just fill in the blank:

!!example

[.s _____ i eneth nín] "My name is _____".

/!

You can also turn this around into a question to ask someone
for their name:

!!example

[.s Man i eneth lín?] "What is your name?"

/!

Another good way of introducing yourself is
[.s _____ estar nin] "They call me _____".

People will probably be able to tell that you're not a
native Sindarin speaker, so as part of introducing yourself
you can tell them where you're from:
[.s _____ i mar nín] "My home is _____".

## Elvish Names

In order to properly introduce yourself in Sindarin, you'll
need an Elvish name. Choose your name with care. Sindarin
names almost always mean something, and in Elvish tradition
names were chosen or bestowed based on the person's
character, achievements, or personal qualities. Because of
this, your chosen name will affect people's first impression
of you.

A comprehensive list of Sindarin names and their meanings
is beyond the scope of this chapter, but a web search for
"Sindarin name list" will turn up good resources.

## Saying Goodbye

Elaborate leave-takings seem to have been a fairly universal
custom in Middle-earth. As such, Sindarin has many ways to
wish people well when you part.

The simplest farewell is perhaps [.s novaer], meaning
"be good", as in "be in good health". [.s Cuio vae] "live well"
expresses a similar sentiment.

If the other party is leaving your meeting-place and you're
staying (for instance, if they were visiting you at your house),
you can wish them well on their travels:

!!example

[.s Calo Anor na ven lín] "May the sun shine on your road"

/!

If you're leaving and the other party is staying, you'll
have to wish them well in a different way:

!!example

[.s No galu na mar lín] "May good fortune be upon your house"

[.s No i Mbelain na le] "May the Valar be with you"

/!

Such phrases, oft repeated, would probably have become abbreviated.
An Elf leaving the house of a friend might utter a simple
[.s.salo Belain na le] "Valar [be] with you".

For a more casual way of saying goodbye, you could try these:

!!example

[.s N'adovaned] "Until we meet again"

[.s N'adgened] "Until I see you again"

/!

## Saying Please

Tolkien never revealed what the Sindarin words for "please"
and "thank you" might be, but there are several
fan-translations of these phrases in common use.

Translating "please" is complicated because English uses the
word in two almost contradictory ways. "Please" can soften
a request, making it more polite. But it can also intensify
a request, as if you are begging or imploring the other
person to do something.

One way to translate a polite request into Sindarin is by
analogy with French _s'il vous plaît_, literally, "if it
pleases you".

!!example

[.s \*ci athol] "If you are willing"

[.s.salo ci athach] "If you are willing"

/!

A more casual way of softening a request is to simply say
[.s anim], "for me".

!!example

[.s \*Holo i fennas anim.] "close the gate for me"

/!

To beg someone to do something, you can try:

!!example

[.s Le nallon!] "I beg you!" (lit. "I cry to you")

/!

## The Complicated History of Thank You

When translating "thank you" for the Lord of the Rings
movies, David Salo drew inspiration from the Quenya verb
_hanta-_ "to thank", arriving at Sindarin [.s.salo le hannon].
There's just one problem with this, though: it violates the
historical sound change rules of Sindarin.
As Helge Fauskanger and others have pointed out,
the Primitive Elvish ancestor of Quenya _hanta-_ would *not*
have produced [.s \*hanna-] in Sindarin if it underwent the
normal sound change rules—instead, we'd get [.s \*anna-].

Unfortunately, we can't use [.s \*anna-] to mean "thank" in
Sindarin, because [.s anna-] already means "give".
[.s \*Le annon] means "I give you", not "I thank you".

In spite of this problem, Salo's translation [.s le hannon]
is still in widespread use on the Web, and therefore must
be considered part of the _living_ Sindarin language.

To avoid the use of [.s le hannon], Sindarin scholar Fiona
Jallings suggests the paraphrase [.s le fael], literally
"you are generous".

If you want to sound less formal, and you're okay with dubious
movie-Sindarin, you can simply say [.s.salo hennaid] "thanks".

## Apologies

If you try to befriend elves, chances are you'll
make an ass of yourself at some point and want to apologize.
Tolkien provides two ways of asking forgiveness:

!!example

[.s Díheno nin!] "Forgive me!"

[.s Goheno nin!] "Forgive me!"

/!

[.s Díheno] seems to be used when asking forgiveness from
a superior, or someone in a position of authority.
[.s Goheno] may connote forgiveness among peers, or perhaps
simply mutual reconciliation. Both of these words come from
his Sindarin translation of the Lord's Prayer:

!!example

[.s ar díheno ammen i úgerth vin] <br/>
And forgive us our trespasses

[.s sui mín i gohenam di ai gerir úgerth ammen] <br/>
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

/!
