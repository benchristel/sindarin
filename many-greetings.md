If you find yourself among elvenfolk, you will probably want
to start your conversations with the basics: "hello", "goodbye",
"please", and "thank you". This chapter will teach you the
rudiments of conversation.

## Saying Hello

[.s Mae govannen] "[You are] well met" is a common informal greeting.
This phrase is a contracted version of [.s Mae ci govannen],
[.s ci] being an informal, affectionate way of saying "you".
Because of this, [.s Mae govannen] is best reserved for
people you already know well. For more formal situations,
such as greeting someone you're not yet close to, you
might try substituting the formal pronoun [.s le]:
[.s Mae le govannen].

[.s Suilad], meaning simply "greeting", is an all-purpose
way of saying hello. It's not known for certain whether words
of this form can be pluralized, but in movie-Sindarin they
can: [.s.salo suilaid] means "greetings". This opens the
door to more effusive variants like [.s.salo rim suilaid]
"many greetings", or [.s.salo meneg suilaid] "a thousand greetings".
Other variants include [.s le suilon] "I greet you", and
the more formal [.s le suilannon] "I give you greeting".

If you're aiming for a formal greeting with a little flourish,
you can say [.s Êl síla na lû govaned 'wín] "A star shines on the hour of our meeting".

## Introductions

To tell someone your name, just fill in the blank:
[.s _____ i eneth nín] "My name is _____".
You can also turn this around into a question to ask someone
for their name:
[.s Man i eneth lín?] "What is your name?"
Another good way of introducing yourself is
[.s _____ estar nin] "They call me _____".

People will probably be able to tell that you're not a
native Sindarin speaker, so as part of introducing yourself
you can tell them where you're from:
[.s _____ i mar nín] "My home is _____"

[.s Man estar le?] "What do they call you?"

## Elvish Names

In order to properly introduce yourself in Sindarin, you'll
need an Elvish name. Choose your name with care. Sindarin
names almost always mean something, and in Elvish tradition
names were chosen or bestowed based on the person's
character, achievements, or personal qualities. Because of
this, your chosen name will affect people's first impression
of you.

## Saying Goodbye

[.s Novaer!] "Farewell!"

[.s Cuio vae!] "Live well!"

[.s No galu na mar lín] "May good fortune be upon your house"

[.s No i Mbelain na le] "May the Valar be with you"

[.s N'adovaded] "Until we meet again"

[.s N'adgened] "Until I see you again"

## Please and Thank You

[.s ci athol] "If you are willing"

[.s.salo ci athach] "If you are willing"

[.s Le nallon!] "I beg you!" (lit. "I cry to you")

[.s annin] "for me"

[.s Le hannon] "I thank you"

[.s.salo Hennaid] "Thanks"

[.s Le fael] "You are generous"

## Apologies

[.s Díheno nin!] "Forgive me!"

[.s Goheno nin!] "Forgive me!"
