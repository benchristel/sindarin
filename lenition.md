The system of [.term consonant mutations] in Sindarin is
one of the language's most iconic features. Mutations cause
the first letter of a word to change under certain
conditions.

Sindarin has several types of consonant mutation. Though
Tolkien scholars disagree on exactly how many there are, it
seems clear that at least three different types
of mutation can occur.

In this lesson, however, we'll just be
covering the most common mutation: the
[.term soft mutation]. In other texts, you might see this
mutation referred to as [.term lenition] (from the Latin
for "softening"). The name comes from the fact that this
mutation tends to make consonants quieter or less abrupt.
For example, it changes the poppy [.s P] sound into a more
subdued [.s B], and [.s D] into [.s DH]. The full set of
changes is described below.

## Mutation Triggers

Consonants don't just mutate for the heck of it. Something
has to trigger the mutation. In Sindarin, there are two
basic reasons for a consonant to mutate:

- [.term Phonological] (sound-based) mutations occur when
  certain sounds appear next to each other. You can imagine
  these mutations as the result of early Sindarin-speaking
  Elves changing a hard-to-pronounce sequence of sounds
  into an easier one.
- [.term Grammatical] mutations are just required by
  particular grammar rules, and aren't related to any
  historical sound-sequence.

In this chapter, we'll be looking at two causes of the
soft mutation, one phonological and one grammatical.

## The Article [.s i]

The word for "the" in Sindarin is [.s i]. This type of word
is called an [.term article]. As in English, [.s i] comes before
the noun it modifies.

!!example

[.s aran] "king" &rarr; [.s i aran] "the king"

[.s edhel] "elf" &rarr; [.s i edhel] "the elf"

/!

Sometimes, a dot or dash is placed between [.s i] and the following noun, to indicate the
close relationship between the words.

!!example

[.s estel] "hope" &rarr; [.s i&middot;estel] "the hope"

/!

As you might have already guessed from my foreshadowing
above, the article [.s i] causes soft mutation on the
following noun. This is a phonological mutation.

Here are the changes caused by the soft mutation:

</table>

That table might look scary, but there are only a few basic
patterns of sound change there; they're just obscured by
the alphabetical ordering. The next sections explain the
patterns.

## Soft Mutation of T, P, and C

The _unvoiced plosives_ [.s T], [.s P], and [.s C] become
voiced plosives [.s D], [.s B], [.s G].

!!example

[.s tawar] "forest" &rarr; [.s i dawar] "the forest"

[.s perian] "hobbit" &rarr; [.s i berian] "the hobbit"

[.s calad] "light" &rarr; [.s i galad] "the light"

/!

## Soft Mutation of D, B, and G

The _voiced plosives_ [.s D], and [.s B] become spirants [.s DH] and [.s V].

!!example

[.s dû] "night" &rarr; [.s i dhû] "the night"

[.s brôg] "bear" &rarr; [.s i vrôg] "the bear"

/!

In ancient forms of Sindarin, [.s G] also became a spirant: the gutteral sound
that's spelled [.s GH] in the Black Speech. Over the years, this sound faded into
inaudibility (probably because the Elves didn't much like it). By the Third Age
it had completely disappeared, which means that [.s G] becomes silent when soft-mutated
in modern Sindarin.

[.TODO use of the gasdil for writing lenited G]

When writing Sindarin in our alphabet, we use an apostrophe
in place of the vanished [.s G]. In _tengwar_, a similar
symbol, called a [.s gasdil] or stopgap, is used.

!!example

[.s goe] "terror, great fear" &rarr; [.s i 'oe] "the terror"

[.s gwath] "shadow" &rarr; [.s i 'wath] "the shadow"

/!

## Soft Mutation of M

The sound [.s M] becomes [.s V].

!!example

[.s men] "way" &rarr; [.s i ven] "the way"

/!

## Soft Mutation of S and H

[.s S] becomes [.s H], and [.s H] becomes [.s CH].

!!example

[.s saew] "poison" &rarr; [.s i haew] "the poison"

[.s haew] "habit" &rarr; [.s i chaew] "the habit"

/!

## Soft Mutation of LH, RH, and HW

The remaining voiceless sounds,
[.s LH], [.s RH], and [.s HW], become [.s THL], [.s THR], and [.s CHW]

!!example

[.s lhûg] "serpent" &rarr; [.s i thlûg] "the serpent"

[.s rhaw] "flesh" &rarr; [.s i thraw] "the flesh"

[.s hwest] "breeze" &rarr; [.s i chwest] "the breeze"

/!

## Mutate sounds, not letters

It is perhaps worth noting that mutations apply to *sounds*, not letters.
For example, [.s TH] is not affected by soft mutation, because it is a separate sound
distinct from [.s T] + [.s H]. However, clusters like [.s TR] *are* mutated since
they actually contain a [.s T] sound.

!!example

[.s thûl] "breath" &rarr; [.s i thûl] "the breath"

[.s trenarn] "tale" &rarr; [.s i drenarn] "the tale"

/!

## Direct Objects

The soft mutation is also triggered on any noun that's the
[.term direct object] of a verb. You can think of the
direct object as the "target" of the action. It contrasts
with the [.term subject], which is the "doer" of the action.
In Sindarin, as in English, the direct object usually comes
after the verb.

Direct objects are often combined with imperative verbs:

!!example

[.s Mado vast!] "Eat bread!" (&larr; [.s bast])

[.s Sogo viruvor!] "Drink <em>miruvor</em>!" (&larr; [.s miruvor])

[.s Berio 'aladh!] "Protect a tree!" (&larr; [.s galadh])

[.s Teitho dêw!] "Write a <em>tengwar</em>-letter!" (&larr; [.s têw])

[.s Eglerio Valan!] "Glorify a <em>Vala</em>!" (&larr; [.s Balan])

/!

You might notice there's no Sindarin word
corresponding to the English "a" in these examples. Sindarin
has no word for "a" or "an"—it's implied if the
definite article [.s i] is absent.

If you add [.s i], the meaning changes thusly:

!!example

[.s Mado i vast!] "Eat the bread!" (&larr; [.s bast])

[.s Sogo i viruvor!] "Drink the <em>miruvor</em>!" (&larr; [.s miruvor])

[.s Berio i 'aladh!] "Protect the tree!" (&larr; [.s galadh])

[.s Teitho i dêw!] "Write the letter!" (&larr; [.s têw])

[.s Eglerio i Valan!] "Glorify the <em>Vala</em>!" (&larr; [.s Balan])

/!

## Only mutate once

One question you might have in mind at this point is:
what happens if a word is *both* a direct object *and*
preceded by the article [.s i]? Does the mutation happen
twice?

The answer is **no**. Only one round of consonant mutation is
*ever* performed on a given word. For example:

!!example

[.s Aphado i berian!] "Follow the hobbit!" (&larr; [.s perian])

/!

Here, [.s perian] "hobbit" is only mutated once, despite it
both being both a direct object and having [.s i] attached.
We don't, in other words, mutate once to [.s i berian]
because of the [.s i] and then again to [.s i verian]
because it's a direct object.

## Words With Irregular Mutation

There are a few words that don't fit the mutation patterns
described above. These words are special because they began
with [.term nasalized stop] consonants ([.s MB], [.s ND],
and [.s NG]) in Old Sindarin. In the Third-age Sindarin
we're learning, these words have dictionary forms beginning
in [.s B], [.s D], or [.s G].

The soft mutation of these words works as follows. The
initial stop consonants become [.term nasals] [.s M],
  [.s N], and [.s NG].

!!example

[.s dîr] "man" &rarr; [.s i nîr] "the man"

[.s bâr] "home" &rarr; [.s i mâr] "the home"

[.s gaur] "werewolf" &rarr; [.s i ngaur] "the werewolf"

/!

Pronouncing [.s NG] (as in _ring_) at the beginning of a
word can be tricky for English speakers. Practice drawing out
the [.s ng] sound and following it up with the rest of the
word: [.s ing-nnnngaur]. With a bit of work, you'll soon
be able to pronounce this sound easily.
