The word for "the" in Sindarin (at least, for singular nouns), is [.s i]. It comes before
the noun it modifies, as in English.

!!example

[.s aran] "king" &rarr; [.s i aran] "the king"

[.s edhel] "elf" &rarr; [.s i edhel] "the elf"

/!

Sometimes, a dot or dash is placed between [.s i] and the following noun, to indicate the
close relationship between the words.

Because of this close relationship, the word [.s i] modifies the initial sound of the following
noun. You may have noticed that within a Sindarin word, some sounds can't occur between vowels:
notably, [.s t], [.s p], and [.s c]. Those sounds *did* occur between vowels in Old Sindarin, but
over time they changed to [.s d], [.s b], and [.s g]. This process of change is often called _lenition_
or _soft mutation_. The same type of mutation occurs in the presence of the word [.s i].

Soft mutation occurs in other places in the language too. These will be covered in later chapters.

## Soft Mutation of T, P, and C

The _unvoiced plosives_ [.s T], [.s P], and [.s C] become
voiced plosives [.s D], [.s B], [.s G].

!!example

[.s tawar] "forest" &rarr; [.s i dawar] "the forest"

[.s perian] "hobbit" &rarr; [.s i berian] "the hobbit"

[.s calad] "light" &rarr; [.s i galad] "the light"

/!

## Soft Mutation of D, B, and G

The _voiced plosives_ [.s D], and [.s B] become spirants [.s DH] and [.s V].

!!example

[.s dû] "night" &rarr; [.s i dhû] "the night"

[.s brôg] "bear" &rarr; [.s i vrôg] "the bear"

/!

In ancient forms of Sindarin, [.s G] also became a spirant: the gutteral sound
that's spelled [.s GH] in the Black Speech. Over the years, this sound faded into
inaudibility (probably because the Elves didn't much like it). By the Third Age
it had completely disappeared, which means that [.s G] becomes silent when soft-mutated
in modern Sindarin.

[.TODO use of the gasdil for writing lenited G]

When writing Sindarin in our alphabet, we use an apostrophe
in place of the vanished [.s G]. In _tengwar_, a similar
symbol, called a [.s gasdil] or stopgap, is used.

!!example

[.s goe] "terror, great fear" &rarr; [.s i 'oe] "the terror"

[.s gwath] "shadow" &rarr; [.s i 'wath] "the shadow"

/!

## Soft Mutation of M

The sound [.s M] becomes [.s V].

!!example

[.s men] "way" &rarr; [.s i ven] "the way"

/!

## Soft Mutation of S and H

[.s S] becomes [.s H], and [.s H] becomes [.s CH].

!!example

[.s saew] "poison" &rarr; [.s i haew] "the poison"

[.s haew] "habit" &rarr; [.s i chaew] "the habit"

/!

## Soft Mutation of LH and RH

[.s LH] and [.s RH] become [.s THL] and [.s THR]

!!example

[.s lhûg] "serpent" &rarr; [.s i thlûg] "the serpent"

[.s rhaw] "flesh" &rarr; [.s i thraw] "the flesh"

/!

## Mutate sounds, not letters

It is perhaps worth noting that mutations apply to *sounds*, not letters.
For example, [.s TH] is not affected by soft mutation, because it is a separate sound
distinct from [.s T] + [.s H]. However, clusters like [.s TR] *are* mutated since
they actually contain a [.s T] sound.

!!example

[.s trenarn] "tale" &rarr; [.s i drenarn] "the tale"

/!
