# The Mirkwood Dialect of Sindarin

## Introduction

- Sindarin is one of the languages of J.R.R. Tolkien
- He never completed it (that wasn't his goal)
- As a result, Sindarin as such is not "usable"
- Fan creations (poetry, translations, etc.) based on Sindarin inevitably involve innovation
- Such innovations on Tolkien canon are called Neo-Elvish
- There are as many "dialects" of Neo-Elvish as there are authors
- As a result, the term Neo-Sindarin is not very meaningful, encompassing as it does a large swath of loosely-clustered opinions on Tolkien's Grey-Elven tongue.
- Nevertheless, this book cannot help but fall under that umbrella and classify itself as a work of Neo-Sindarin.

- The incomplete Elvish tongues are abstract and insubstantial; try to pin down firmly any word of vocabulary or rule of grammar, and it will inevitably get away from you; the more you try to specify exactly what it is, the more the truth will elude you; you will see contradictions in the data with no certain explanation.
- in a sense, they are not really even languagesâ€”Tolkien admits as much.
- learning them is impossible. One can only learn about them, and even that amounts in large part to understanding where the many uncertainties and gaps in our knowledge lie.

- It could be argued that the ethereality of Sindarin suits it; that it reinforces its position in Tolkien's mythos as the tongue of an ancient and immortal people beyond human ken. But Tolkien's languages are praised above all for their consistency and depth, and the theoretical knowability resulting from this is a large part of what intrigues us about them. Tolkien's Elves are not airy-fairy folk, and the Elvish languages are not like butterflies that can't be grasped without destroying them. Their appearance of solidity, not their ungraspability, is what gives them charm; indeed, many are dismayed when they discover that the Elvish languages cannot be mastered or spoken.

- Tolkien envisioned many dialects of his Elvish languages, but as far as we know never wrote down any details of them.
- He only drops tantalizing hints: 'e' for 'ae' -- what was Mirkwood Sindarin like, besides that? Tolkien writes about the Elvish populations as if he imagined them being fairly isolated; Mirkwood Sindarin could have been as different from Classical Sindarin as Danish is from Norwegian.
- Into this lacuna, fan-writers may well pour their own embellishments, as map-makers of old used to fill any vacant space with myths of their own making: "here be dragons".
- This book is one such embellishment.
- Credit where it's due: I cite Tolkien's works to document the origin of every vocabulary word and grammatical rule. In doing so my purpose is twofold: to illuminate the genius with which Tolkien constructed his languages, and to emphasize the fact that hard data about the language are very hard to come by; sources are often contradictory.
