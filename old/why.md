Studying an Elvish Language: What? Why? How?

- Why did Tolkien create these languages in the first place?
- cite A Secret Vice
- Expression of personal linguistic aesthetic
- Fascination with dead / historical languages

Possible reasons

There are many reasons why someone might set out to learn an Elvish language.
Some will be met with more success than others. Some lead only to frustration.

- the thrill of a chase! / puzzle
  Yes! Tolkien's languages are very deep, intricate systems that can be puzzled over for hours--just what you would expect from the life's work of a professor of philology.
- euphony
  If you find the names and phrases from LotR pleasing, learning the languages in more depth will likely give you great pleasure. The languages do have rough edges, though, and the more you try to compose in them, the more likely it is that you will come up with things that don't sound good. The languages seem to be optimized for names and short utterances, not long texts. Tolkien's words are like delicious sweets that each have a unique, subtle flavor; enjoyed on their own, they are delightful, but if you stuff a handful at once into your mouth the flavors will clash and the result will not be as pleasant. But that may be true of any language; well-composed poetry in Elvish can certainly be beautiful.
- use the languages for one's own fiction, or in roleplaying games
  Proceed with caution. The languages are not "complete" enough in their lexicon and grammar to be used for anything you please. Tolkien never intended the languages to be usable in this way, so in trying to do so you will inevitably have to reconstruct or make up words, and every time you do that you drift farther away from speaking a true Tolkien-language. If you just want an Elvish-style language for a non-Tolkien setting, there are plenty to choose from that are designed specifically for RP. If you're writing your own fiction set in a non-Tolkien universe, you should probably just create your own language to avoid legal issues (link to Zompist). If you are RPing or writing fanfic in a Tolkien setting, you have a few options. I would advise you not to underestimate the power of names (of characters and places). The elvish languages have many holes and inconsistencies, but the rules for building names are quite well-attested. Additionally, you will not get many opportunities to incorporate Elvish dialogue into your game or fanfic, but names will recur over and over again. If you do want to add some simple phrases of dialogue, it's hard to go wrong with greetings and commands, which are fairly well attested and quite easy to learn the grammar for.
- for the geek cred
- learn linguistics or understand real languages better
- recreation of "Elvendom on Earth"
  - It's very hard to learn a language from even an excellent textbook, when you have no native speakers around.
  - It's even harder to learn a culture from a book. But the fact is, the "excellent" textbooks on Elvish are not tutorials for beginners, but scholarly works. They are excellent not because they make Elvish easy or accessible, but because they recognize that it is (by design) neither an easy nor an accessible subject, and address those complexities appropriately. To the extent that Tolkien's elves represent a vision of "perfected" humankind, his interpretation of that vision was retrospective rather than aspirational (garden of Eden, not paradise on earth) which is (I surmise) one of the reasons that the Third Age sees the elves diminishing and passing into the West.
  - The languages _per se_ contain very few insights into Tolkien's vision of Elvish culture.
  - If there is a way in which Tolkien's languages can aid the expression of a subculture, it is this: the languages become a token of solidarity, an in-group shibboleth, a wall against the outside world. But for this purpose, any invented or little-known language will serve. Tolkien's Elvish languages are not intended for this use, which is more appropriate to Nevbosh.
- understand Tolkien's life and work better (cf. quote from letters about how he will never write an autobiography bc his preferred form of expression is creative)

Staying true to Tolkien's Intentions

We owe it to Tolkien's memory not to abuse or misrepresent his languages. I propose the following totally unofficial and non-authoritative code of conduct.

- To welcome newcomers to the study of Tolkien's languages
- To mark reconstructed or otherwise unattested Elvish forms in our writing.
- To correct (gently!) definite mistakes where we see them, including in our own writing.
- To understand the limits on our knowledge and authority, and recognize that others may draw different conclusions from the data than we have.

Are reconstructions OK? The reconstructions that we come up with are not "true Tolkien", but I would argue that the _act of reconstructing the language_ is _very_ Tolkienish, and in fact one of the primary joys of the language and one of the reasons that Tolkien created the languages in the way that he did. As long as we do not pretend that our reconstructions are Tolkien canon, I think there's no harm in them.

I would also like to point out that a language is an abstract system of rules for putting together sounds into words and words into sentences. It only takes concrete form in the words and sentences so produced. This may seem obvious, but here is the conclusion I want to draw. Stating a rule of grammar implies the forms that are created by that rule--in fact, I might go so far as to say that the definition of a grammar rule is the set of forms that it can create when applied to a given lexicon of words. Thus, if we are willing to state general rules for forming plurals in Sindarin (for instance), we should not balk at stating that the plural of X is Y, even if the latter form is unattested in Tolkien's works. If no exception for X is stated in our rule, the rule implies that the plural of X is Y, so if we feel like stating this explicitly as an example we might as well. We'd do well, of course, to mark our example as unattested, but shouldn't we then mark the entire grammar rule as unattested, since its very purpose is to implicitly define a universe of unattested forms?

- Tolkien posed as the investigator / historian of his own world. He didn't "make stuff up", he "discovered" it. We are _actually_ discovering; we can't just create things by sheer authorial fiat. Reconstructions still have a place; as long as we acknowledge that we are speaking a "reconstructed" form of Elvish and know the difference between what is reconstructed and what is attested, there's no harm in the reconstruction itself. Tolkien himself wrote in a reconstructed version of Gothic, and his investigations into that language were one of the inspirations for the Elvish tongues. 

While T. could approach the historical/reconstructive aspect of the languages directly, we aren't reconstructing the languages as much as we are Tolkien's intentions about them.

"Elvish as She Is Spoke," while a good essay in many regards, quotes Tolkien mostly out of context: "These seem to me no more than private
amusements, and as such I have no right or power to object to them,
though they are, I think, valueless for the elucidation or interpretation
of my fiction. If published, I do object to them, when (as they usually
do) they appear to be unauthentic embroideries on my work, throwing
light only on the state of mind of their contrivers, not on me or on
my actual intention and procedure" Tolkien was not referring here to attempts to use or reconstruct Elvish, but to authors' attempts to find "hidden meanings" or relationships between the Elvish words in LotR and real-world languages. In that letter, Tolkien calls this out as a total misunderstanding of his actual goals and creative process. C.F.H. sneakily tries to associate this quote with his own thesis, stating that it "seems [...] fully applicable". This "seems" is a weasel word; it seems mostly to be wishful thinking. The next quote from _Letters_ is also wilfully taken out of context—it was about translation of Tolkien's works into other languages, in which translations his Elvish words were often butchered.

Those misguided quotations aside, EASIS does make some good points about Tolkien's purposes and process. Especially that his intention was not to create a complete language, but to create something beautiful.

Tolkien was somewhat particular about how his words should be used. He disapproved, for instance, of the application of the names _Glorfindel_ and _Elrond_ to bulls (he apparently felt the names, meaning "Golden hair" and "Cave of stars", were at odds with the nature of cattle) but helpfully suggested different ones based on the suffix -mund "bull". He refrained from the vanity of giving himself an Elvish name (citation needed, Letters), but at least considered inscribing "Lúthien" on the gravestone of his wife Edith (I don't know if he actually did or not)—not because he ever called her that, but because she was the original inspiration for the story of Beren and Lúthien.

So, what would Tolkien think of our modern attempts to understand and use his languages?

- He probably wouldn't want his languages to be "completed" and used if it meant they would be dumbed down in any way, or used for trivial everyday matters. (see: A Secret Vice) He consistently treated his languages with gravity (self-effacing remarks about his "mad hobby" notwithstanding) and would probably appreciate others doing the same.
- He would probably be somewhat mortified that people were giving such close attention to something that had started out as a very private hobby. In a field where the merest jotting of Tolkien's can inspire a flurry of discussion and analysis, the Professor would probably beg for some of his less considered notes to be overlooked. There would probably also be parts of the languages he would want to change after seeing the texts that others produced--keep in mind that even we write something in Elvish that seems fully supported by evidence from Tolkien's works, that's no guarantee that he would have liked it!
