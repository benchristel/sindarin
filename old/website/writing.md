# Writing Sindarin in the Elvish Scripts

## Overview of the Writing Systems

The two major writing systems used for Sindarin were the [.s tîw] (better known by their Quenya name _tengwar_), and the [.s cirth] (pronounced "keerth"). The _tengwar_ were a flowing script suitable for writing with a brush or pen, while the runic [.s cirth] were angular, designed for scratching or carving into stone or wood.

### Tengwar

The _tengwar_ were invented by Fëanor in Aman, and so were first used to write Quenya. But Fëanor, always ambitious, didn't just devise an alphabet solely for his own language. He created a system so versatile that it could be adapted to *any* language. Thus when the exiled Noldor brought the _tengwar_ to Middle-earth, the Sindar readily adopted the script. By the Third Age there were multiple styles or "modes" for writing Sindarin with _tengwar_, each with its own spelling conventions.

Even Sauron recognized the beauty of _tengwar_ and used them to write the inscription (in the Black Speech) on the One Ring:

</p>
</div>

### Cirth

The _cirth_, in contrast to the _tengwar_, were invented in Middle-earth, so in a sense they are the most natively Sindarin writing system. However, they did not reach their most mature form, the _Angerthas Daeron_, until after the exiled Noldor returned to Middle-earth. The _Angerthas_ or "long rune-rows" were inspired by the organization of the _tengwar_, and like the _tengwar_ could be applied to many different languages.

## Resources for Learning the Writing Systems

- Appendix E to _The Lord of the Rings_ – The authoritative source for much of our information about the _tengwar_ and _cirth_. Unfortunately for beginners, it makes heavy use of linguistic terms, so it's not the most accessible resource. It presents guidelines for writing Sindarin, Quenya, English, and the Black Speech, but Tolkien, presumably to save space, doesn't give each language its own section—he presents them all together in a jumble. You basically have to comprehend the whole thing before you can write in any of the languages it discusses.
- [_Tîw i Lam Thindrim_, by Per Lindberg](http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/teng-sin.pdf) – available as a PDF download. It's a good summary of the major Sindarin tengwar modes. Oddly, the tables showing the pronunciation of each _tengwa_ are at the end of the document. I'd advise printing out the last two pages and keeping them handy while you read the rest of it.
- [_A Gateway to Sindarin_, by David Salo](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/a-gateway-to-sindarin-david-salo/1111582229) – Salo's book describes how to use the _tengwar_ and _cirth_ to write Sindarin, and is the best secondary source that I know of for learning the _cirth_. However, it assumes some linguistic knowledge (such as a general familiarity with phonetic alphabets) as well as a basic understanding of the historical development of Sindarin. It's also pretty pricey, and has received some <a href="http://www.science-and-fiction.org/elvish/salo_discussion.html">critical feedback</a> for its approach to the language. While the chapter on writing is good, I would not recommend buying it for that chapter alone.
