## Changes Preceding Common Eldarin

velars labialized before w, and ŋʷ became ŋʷgʷ
```
w/ʷ/<velar>_
ŋʷ/ŋʷgʷ/_
```

the second vowel in a word sometimes (when?) disappeared when unstressed. NOTE: this is based on Salo 4.3, but the environments are conjectural.
```
<short vowel>//#(C)Vk_t
<short vowel>//#(C)Vs_C
<short vowel>//#(C)V<unvoiced stop>_l
```

s became z before voiced stops
```
s/z/_<voiced stop>
```

voiced stops followed by nasals at the same place of articulation underwent metathesis
```
dn/nd/_
bm/mb/_
gŋ/ŋg/_
```

Long vowels shortened in closed syllables
```
<long vowel>/<short vowel>/_CC
```
