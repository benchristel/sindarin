## Pronunciation

Before you start to put Sindarin words together into sentences, it's a good idea to learn how the words themselves are supposed to be pronounced. One of Tolkien's goals in designing his languages was to create words that he personally found beautiful, and he wrote a great deal about his love for the sounds of certain languages (notably Welsh and Finnish). With this in mind, it should be clear that correct pronunciation of Tolkien's languages is essential to appreciate them fully.

No pronunciation guide can be perfect, but recordings of Tolkien reading excerpts from _The Lord of the Rings_ provide the best possible guide to many of the words and names from his legendarium. Samples from those recordings can be found [on Glǽmscrafu](http://www.jrrvf.com/~glaemscrafu/english/tolkienhimself.html).

### Vowels

Sindarin vowels are comparable to those of Spanish. A, E, I, O, and U are pronounced "ah", "eh", "ee", "oh", and "oo". More specifically (assuming a General American accent)[^vowels]:

* A as in "father"
* E as in "pen"
* I as in "machine"
* O as in "old"
* U as in "brute"

[^vowels]: Tolkien's own pronunciation guide, in Appendix E, gives "father", "were", "machine", "for", and "brute" as the exemplars. "Were" and "for" are problematic for American speakers as the R-sound colors the vowel of "for" and completely replaces the vowel of "were". I have replaced these with "pen" and "old", though these words too present problems. Speakers with the pen/pin merger may find the former confusing, and the latter probably does not sufficiently illustrate the openness of Sindarin _o_.

Sindarin also has a sixth vowel, Y, whose sound has no equivalent in English. It is the sound of _u_ in French _lune_, or German _ü_ as in _über_. Unlike the English letter Y, Sindarin Y is always a vowel, never a consonant as in "yes".

In Sindarin, the vowels can be marked with an acute accent (á é í ó ú) indicating that they are held for a slightly longer duration. So in a word like _míriel_ "sparkling like jewels" (TODO cite translation), the first syllable _mí_ is held for two "beats", the second syllable _ri_ for one beat, and the third syllable _el_ for one beat (though it may actually take as long to say as _mí_ because of the final L).

A circumflex (â ê î ô û) also indicates a long vowel, but is only used in words of one syllable. This may just be an aesthetic whim of Tolkien's, though he justified it by saying that vowels with the circumflex should be held for _even longer_—three beats instead of two. However, the Elvish writing systems only distinguish two vowel lengths, long and short, so the Elves must not have considered this detail very important.

#### Typing Accented Characters

On a Mac, you can type vowels with an acute accent by pressing `option+E` and then typing the vowel that you want. To type a circumflex, use `option+I` instead.

Typing special characters on Windows is considerably more annoying. The best way is probably to change your keyboard settings to international mode, which will let you type accented letters using key combinations. A guide to doing that can be found [here](http://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/accents/codeint.html). Alternatively, you can copy and paste the accented letters from the table below.

## Consonants

Many Sindarin consonants are pronounced as in English, and so need no further explanation. These include B, D, H, M, N, P, T, V, and W. The others require some special attention.

- C is always hard, as in "cat". _Celeborn_ is pronounced _Keleborn_, not _Seleborn_.
- CH is the sound in Scottish _loch_ or German _Bach_.
- DH is the sound of _th_ in _this_. (Compare to TH, below. If you're having trouble keeping the DH/TH distinction straight, remember that DH is like Z pronounced with an exaggerated lisp.)
- F is usually pronounced as in English, except at the end of a word, where it sounds like V (think English "of"). The word _nef_ "on this side of" is thus pronounced _nev_ as in English "never". The Elvish writing systems don't reflect this complication—the V sound is there always spelled the same, regardless of where it appears in the word.
- G is always hard, as in "get". The Elvish languages do not have the J-sound heard in "gem".
- HW is the _wh_ sound of "whale", in varieties of English that pronounce it differently from "wail".
- L is always pronounced as in "let", with the tip of the tongue touching or just behind the upper teeth. In English, L is sometimes pronounced with the tongue bunched up in the back of the mouth, as in "cold", but this variant of L does not exist in Sindarin.
- LH is the sound of _LL_ in Welsh—a peculiar sound, if you've not heard it before. To pronounce it, put your tongue in a position to say L, and blow gently. The resulting sound should be somewhere between _th_ and _sl_ (in fact, the LH sound developed from earlier SL, found in Old Sindarin).
- PH is pronounced as in _photograph_. In the middle of a word, it represents a lengthened F-sound: a word like _ephel_ "outer fence" would be pronounced _ef-fel_.
- NG at the beginning or end of a word is the sound heard in "ringer". In the middle of a word it represents the same sound plus G, as in "finger".
- R is trilled, as in Spanish. In Appendix E, Tolkien notes that the back-of-the-throat R-sound heard in French or German was not used by the Elves.
- RH is a Sindarin R-sound pronounced voicelessly—that is, without the vocal cords vibrating. If you can pronounce R and HW, you're halfway to pronouncing RH. Just pronounce R while exhaling breathily as for HW.
- S never sounds like Z, as it often does in English at the end of a word. It is always pronounced as in "set".
- TH is the sound of _th_ in _thin_. (Compare to DH, above.)

N.B. The combinations DH, LH, RH, TH sometimes represent a sequence of two distinct sounds, e.g. T+H. For example, _Panthael_ (A name given to Sam Gamgee by Aragorn in the King's Letter), is a compound _pant_ "full" + _sael_ "wise" (_sael_ being mutated to _hael_ in this case), so the _t_ and _h_ represent distinct sounds. Similarly, _Edhelharn_ "Elfstone", one of Aragorn's epithets, is compounded from _edhel_ "elf" + _sarn_ "stone" (mutated to _harn_).
