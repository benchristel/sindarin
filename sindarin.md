# The Sindarin Language

When the first Elves awoke on the shores of Cuiviénen, they began to make a language. The first word they spoke, according to later Elven lore, was _ele!_—an exclamation of wonder and delight that they uttered upon first seeing the stars. They called themselves _kwendī_, meaning "those who speak", since they knew of no other beings that could use language.

When the Vala Arômez (called in later Quenya _Oromë_) found the _kwendī_ and told them of Aman, the land of the Valar beyond the sea, some Elves wished to go there and some were afraid to make the journey. Those who refused the journey were called the _abarī_. They were lost in the wilds of Middle-earth and play small part in its later history. Those who heeded Oromë and marched across Middle-earth to the shores of the Great Sea were called _edeloī_—in later Quenya, _eldar_.

During the journey, the Elves were sundered yet again. The Vanyar and Noldor, who arrived at the shore first, made the voyage across the Sea to Aman. Those who tarried behind, the Teleri, waited at the shore, torn between their love for Middle-earth and their desire to cross the sea. Before they could begin the sea voyage, their leader, Elwë, crossed the path of Melian, a Maia. He fell at once in love with her and for many years they remained under an enchantment in the forest of Nan Elmoth. The other Teleri could not find him, and many refused to cross the Sea without their lord. They remained in Middle-earth.

Two hundred years later, Elwë reappeared, and with Melian as his queen reassumed rulership of the Teleri. As the long, sunless years passed and the Teleri and Noldor remained sundered, their speech gradually changed. The language of the Noldor became the speech known in the Third Age as Quenya, while the Teleri came to speak a language that had as yet no name, for since their separation from the Noldor they heard no speech except their own and needed no word to distinguish it.

When the Noldorin exiles returned to Middle-earth, and Elwë learned of the Kinslaying they had committed at Alqualondë, he banned their language Quenya from his realm. Thereafter, the Elves of Middle-earth spoke the language of Elwë, but since that language had no name of its own it was given a Quenya one: _Sindarin_.

Sindarin was from its beginnings the language of a people that loved and revered Middle-earth. It is perhaps because of this that Sindarin, more so than Quenya, echoes in its words the changefulness of the mortal world.

> _A Elbereth Gilthoniel,_
> _silivren penna míriel_
> _o menel aglar elenath!_
> _Na-chaered palan-díriel_
> _o galadhremmin ennorath,_
> _Fanuilos, le linnathon_
> _nef aear, sí nef aearon!_

## External History

Tolkien did not, of course, develop Sindarin in a vacuum. He was greatly inspired by the Welsh language, which he encountered in his childhood and later studied. When he was in his early twenties, he created the language _Goldogrin_, inspired by Welsh. In Goldogrin we can see the predecessors of many Sindarin words and grammatical patterns.

The sounds and general aesthetic of the language are based largely on Welsh, one of Tolkien's favorite real-world languages. Like Welsh, Sindarin has a system of consonant mutations: the initial consonant of a word can change in certain situations.
