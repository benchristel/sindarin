_Ómatehtar_, Quenya for "vowel-marks", are the dots and curls
often seen above _tengwar_ letters (for example, in the Ring inscription). Essentially, they
are abbreviations for vowel letters: rather than writing
out the vowels in full, _ómatehta_ modes represent
them as marks above an adjacent consonant.

Since _ómatehtar_ are such
an iconic part of _tengwar_, I couldn't resist including at
least one English _ómatehta_ mode in this book. The mode
presented here was not created by Tolkien; it is a
"simplified" mode invented by artist Daniel Reeve, who did
much of the _tengwar_ calligraphy for the _Lord of the Rings_
films.

(Now is perhaps as good a time as any to note that the _h_ of _tehtar_
is not silent; it's the slightly raspy sound heard in German _ich_.
Thus _tehtar_ is pronounced _TEKH-tar_.)

## The Basics of _Ómatehtar_

Each of the vowels A E I O U (and Y as in _sky_) has a unique
mark, or _tehta_, to represent it. The _tehtar_ are shown
in Figure 1. Since they are always written over a _tengwa_ (or under it, in the case of Y), the
letter [.t 1] is used as a placeholder.

When written over a consonant, a _tehta_ may represent
either the vowel before or the vowel after that consonant.
Thus, [.t 1E] could stand for either _TA_ or _AT_. You
may use either convention when writing in the English mode,
but one must always
be consistent within a text (or it will be very hard to
read what you've written!) Personally, I prefer to have the
_tehtar_ stand for the vowel *after* the consonant—I find
it a bit easier to read that way.

Often you'll find that you need to write a vowel but there's
no consonant to write it over. Trivial examples are one-vowel words like
"I" and "a". In such cases, the _tehta_ cannot simply stand
on its own, so we give it a silent "carrier" letter [.t \`] to sit on.
Thus "I" would be written [.t \`B] and "a" [.t \`C].

Usually, a _tengwa_ may only have one vowel-_tehta_ written
over it, so vowel clusters like the EA in _tea_ must use
the silent carrier: [.t 1R\`C].


## The Reeve English Mode

It is possible to use the _tehtar_, as described above,
as abbreviations of the vowels in the Brogan mode. That's
not often done, however; for some reason most _tengwar_
modes tend to use _ómatehtar_ consistently, or not at all,
and the Brogan mode is one of the ones that doesn't use them.

Daniel Reeve's English mode, presented below, is an example
of a mode that *does* use _ómatehtar_. You will notice some
similarities to the Brogan mode, but many of the letters
have different English values.

## Differences from the Brogan Mode

First, it is worth noting that almost all of the letters of
the first five rows of the table have the same values as in
the Brogan mode. The exceptions are [.t s] = J, [.t f] = H,
and [.t g] = NK.

You'll notice that there are two _tengwar_ for R, two for W,
and two for Y. The letters [.t 6], [.t y], and [.t h] are
used at the end of a word and before a consonant: [.t eD6] "far",
[.t qEh] "pay", [.t iEy] "saw", [.t iEy5] "sawn". Elsewhere,
[.t 7], [.t .], and [.t l] are preferred: [.t 7Dy] "raw",
[.t .F81] "west", [.t lR1] "yet".

The tengwa [.t u], not found in the Brogan mode, can
be used for RH at the beginning of a word: [.t uÎtÈ] "rhyme".

The two letters for S can be interchanged freely. [.t i]
is preferred when a _tehta_ is written over the S.
In the movies [.t i] is often used even when there is no _tehta_.

Now you can try your hand at deciphering this quote:

!!example

[.ti «\`Cj¸ .F f#r$ 1Y 2$aT2$ \`Bi o#1 1Y 2^ .G3 @ 1Tt$ 4#1 \`Bi x%r$5 \`Mi-» Â x#2P#je]

/!

## Word Abbreviations

The Reeve mode uses the same abbreviations for "and", "the",
and "of the" as the Brogan mode, but "of" on its own is
simply written [.t \`Ne].

## Letter Abbreviations

The Reeve mode uses the same letter abbreviations as the
Brogan mode for double consonants, nasal clusters, silent Es, and
final S. Double vowels EE and OO are written by doubling the
_tehta_: [.t 1][.ta Y] "too", [.t i][.ta R] "see".

## Exercises

Can you read the following text?

[.todo Whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell off in front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally did rather suddenly), he fell off behind. Otherwise he kept on pretty well, except that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways; and as he generally did this on the side on which Alice was walking, she soon found that it was the best plan not to walk quite close to the horse.]
