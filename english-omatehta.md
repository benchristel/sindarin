_Ómatehtar_, Quenya for "vowel-marks", are the dots and curls
above the letters in the Ring inscription. Essentially, they
are abbreviations for vowel letters: rather than writing
out the vowels in full, _ómatehta_ modes represent
them as marks above an adjacent consonant.

Since _ómatehtar_ are such
an iconic part of _tengwar_, I couldn't resist including at
least one English _ómatehta_ mode in this book. The mode
presented here was not created by Tolkien; it is a
"simplified" mode invented by artist Daniel Reeve, who did
much of the _tengwar_ calligraphy for the _Lord of the Rings_
films.

(Now is perhaps as good a time as any to note that the _h_ of _tehtar_
is not silent; it's the slightly raspy sound heard in German _ich_.
Thus _tehtar_ is pronounced _TEKH-tar_.)

## The Basics of _Ómatehtar_

Each of the vowels A E I O U (and Y as in _sky_) has a unique
mark, or _tehta_, to represent it. The _tehtar_ are shown
in Figure 1. Since they are always written over a _tengwa_ (or under it, in the case of Y), the
letter [.t 1] is used as a placeholder.

When written over a consonant, a _tehta_ may represent
either the vowel before or the vowel after that consonant.
Thus, [.t 1E] could stand for either _TA_ or _AT_. Which
convention to use is up to you, but one must always
be consistent within a text (or it will be very hard to
read what you've written!) Personally, I prefer to have the
_tehtar_ stand for the vowel *after* the consonant—I find
it a bit easier to read that way.

## The Reeve English Mode

It is possible to use the _tehtar_, as described above,
as abbreviations of the vowels in the Brogan mode. That's
not often done, however; for some reason most _tengwar_
modes tend to use _ómatehtar_ consistently, or not at all,
and the Brogan mode is one of the ones that doesn't use them.

Daniel Reeve's English mode, presented below, is an example
of a mode that *does* use _ómatehtar_. You will notice some
similarities to the Brogan mode, but many of the letters
have different English values.
