# Table of Contents

This text is divided into four sections: two short and introductory, two long and in-depth. The first two, _The Tengwar Writing System_ and _Speaking Sindarin_, will give you a taste of the language, and a basic understanding of many of the elvish names, phrases, and inscriptions in _The Lord of the Rings_. The third section, the _Grammar of Sindarin_, is a deeper look at the rules that govern the construction of words and phrases. Finally, there is the _History of Sindarin_, which describes how the languages of the Elves changed through the long histories of Middle-earth and of Aman in the West.
