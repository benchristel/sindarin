Tolkien's _tengwar_ script is instantly recognizable—nothing evokes "elvish" like a snippet of _tengwar_ text. It's easy to understand why the _tengwar_ are popular—you don't have to be a Tolkien buff or a language geek to be struck by their beauty.

</p>

That's the One Ring inscription, probably the most famous example of the Elvish script. But if you get it tattooed around your arm and claim that it's in an Elvish *language*, the joke's on you—it's actually Sauron's Black Speech, written with _tengwar_ letters. Transcribed into our Roman alphabet, the Ring inscription goes:

<p class="center text">
<em>
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,<br/>
ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
</em>
</p>

Not sounds that any Elf would want to utter!

This serves to highlight an important point: the _tengwar_ aren't a language; they're a writing system that, much like our own alphabet, can be applied to many different languages.

This chapter focuses on writing Sindarin, though there's also a section on how to write English with _tengwar_.

The _tengwar_ were invented by Fëanor in Aman, and so were first used to write Quenya. But Fëanor, always ambitious, didn't just devise an alphabet solely for his own language. He created a system so versatile that it could be adapted to *any* language. Thus when the exiled Noldor brought the _tengwar_ to Middle-earth, they were able to use the script to write Sindarin. By the Third Age there were multiple styles or "modes" for writing Sindarin with _tengwar_, each with its own spelling conventions.

## The Mode of Beleriand

The _Mode of Beleriand_ is the most ancient of the Sindarin tengwar styles. The letters correspond one-to-one with Sindarin sounds, as shown below:

### Vowels and Diphthongs

Long vowels were given an accent mark: [.t &#93;F] represented [.s á] or [.s â]. The Sindarin term for this is [.s andaith] "long-mark".

For diphthongs, the scribes used a _tengwa_ to represent the first vowel. A mark (_tehta_ in Quenya) above the _tengwa_ was often used for the second vowel. However, Tolkien notes in Appendix E that "the diphthongs were often written out in full", as [.t &#93;l] in the _tengwar_ transcription of _A Elbereth Gilthoniel_.

### Abbreviations

The early Sindarin scribes liked to abbreviate common letter com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tions. Double [.s NN] and [.s MM] were represented by doubling the curved "bow" of [.t 6] and [.t y], producing [.t 5] and [.t t]. An [.s N] or [.s M] before another consonant was abbreviated as a bar or wavy line above the consonant: [.t 1p] for [.s NT], [.t wP] for [.s MB], etc.

### The Complicated Matter of _W_

A mark like a flattened S (also used for the diphthong [.s AU]) might have been used for a following [.s W] sound: [.s Narwain] "January" might have been written [.t 6&#93;7ê&#93;Ö6]. In Appendix E, Tolkien mentions that this symbol was "required for the expression of <em>au</em>, <em>aw</em>," perhaps meaning that it was used only in that circumstance, and [.t n] was used elsewhere for [.s W].
For [.s GW], there is an additional layer of complication. The Noldor, on first encountering Sindarin, would likely have used [.t x] for [.s GW], since that spelling closely mirrors Quenya. [.s Gwirith] "April" might be written [.t x&#96;7&#96;3]. This ties in nicely with the use of [.t c] for [.s CHW], which Tolkien implies (but does not quite state) in Appendix E: <q><em>hwesta sindarinwa</em> [[.t o]] or <q>Grey-elven <em>hw</em></q> was so called because in Quenya [[.t c]] had the sound of <em>hw</em>, and distinct signs for <em>chw</em> and <em>hw</em> were not required.</q>

Thus, the possibilities for writing [.s GW] are:

- [.t x&#96;7&#96;3] &middot; [.s Gwirith]
- [.t sè&#96;7&#96;3] &middot; [.s Gwirith]
- [.t sn&#96;7&#96;3] &middot; [.s Gwirith]

Which of these was used is not certain.

For other consonant clusters ending in [.s W], there are only two possibilities: the [.t &nbsp;ê]-_tehta_ or the _tengwa_ [.t n].

- [.t 6&#93;7ê&#93;Ö6] &middot; [.s Narwain]
- [.t 6&#93;7n&#93;Ö6] &middot; [.s Narwain]

### Ambiguities

When writing in tengwar, keep in mind that the Elves didn't use our Roman alphabet, so they would have spelled Sindarin words according to their sound and not the letters we use to represent them. [.s Nef] ends with a "v" sound and so should be spelled [.t 6lr] in tengwar. Similarly, [.t m] is only used for [.s LH] when the single sound [.s LH] is meant. [.s Edhelharn], being a compound [.s Edhel] + [.s harn], would be spelt [.t l4lj9&#93;76]. The issue of spelling ambiguities is covered <a class="pageref" href="#splitting-up-letter-combinations"></a>.

## The Organization of the _Tengwar_

The table of consonants for the Mode of Beleriand is pretty dyslexia-inducing: the letters all look sort of similar but there's no obvious pattern in the way they're assigned to sounds.

In fact, there _is_ a pattern—it's just not apparent when the _tengwar_ are arranged according to our alphabet. Here are the main _tengwar_ as the Elves arranged them:

<table class="col-3 columns">
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>[.tab T][.t.letterform 1]</li>
<li>[.tab D][.t.letterform 2]</li>
<li>[.tab TH][.t.letterform 3]</li>
<li>[.tab DH][.t.letterform 4]</li>
<li>[.tab NN][.t.letterform 5]</li>

<li>[.tab B][.t.letterform w]</li>
<li>[.tab F][.t.letterform e]</li>
<li>[.tab V][.t.letterform r]</li>
<li>[.tab MM][.t.letterform t]</li>
<li>[.tab M][.t.letterform y]</li>
</ul>

<li>[.tab CH][.t.letterform d]</li>
<li>[.tab &nbsp;][.t.letterform f]</li>
<li>[.tab NG][.t.letterform g]</li>
<li>[.tab O][.t.letterform h]</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

In the top row are the hard, _unvoiced_ consonants, which all have a downward "stem" (Quenya _telco_) and single "bow" (_lúva_). In the second row, we have the voiced counterparts of these—the voicing being reflected in the _tengwar_ by doubling the _lúva_.

The third and fourth rows are almost a duplicate of the first two—the difference is that the _telqui_ (pl. of _telco_) are extended up instead of down. The associated sounds are _spirants_, which draw out the sound into a hiss or buzz.

The fifth and sixth rows are a little more chaotic; [.t h] for [.s O] is the odd letter out as all the others represent _nasals_ (sounds that redirect air through the nose).

If we look at the _columns_ of the table, a complementary pattern emerges. The first column has all the _dental_ consonants, which place the tip of the tongue on (or just behind) the upper teeth. The second column is all _labial_ consonants, which involve the lips. And the third column (with the exception of the outlier [.t h]) is all _velar_ consonants, in which the tongue rises to the roof of the mouth.

Note that the letter [.t f] fills out the pattern but doesn't have an associated Sindarin sound. If we follow the pattern of the other _tengwar_, the sound of [.t f] would be a voiced version of [.s CH]. This gutteral sound doesn't occur in Sindarin but is present in the Black Speech, for example in _agh_ "and".

What about the other _tengwar_, like [.t j], [.t 7], and [.t 8]? Their sounds don't fit into the grid system so nicely, and their irregular shapes (deviating from the _telco_-_lúva_ pattern) reflect this.

## The _Ómatehta_ Mode

_Ómatehtar_ (Quenya for "vowel-signs") are the dots and curls above the letters in the Ring inscription. In LotR Appendix E they're referred to simply as _tehtar_, or "marks". They represent the vowels in many _tengwar_ modes.

_Ómatehtar_ were not used until late in Sindarin's history. The Sindarin _ómatehta_ mode is associated mainly with the Men of Gondor, and is sometimes called the Mode of Gondor.

The consonant letters follow mostly the same patterns in the Mode of Beleriand, but except for [.s C],  [.s CH], [.s G]. In Gondor, the letters [.t a], [.t s], and [.t d]  were used for writing the sounds _ch_ (as in _church_), _j_, and _sh_, which were common in the Westron language. Gondorians thus preferred to use [.t z], [.t c], and [.t x] for Sindarin [.s C], [.s CH], and [.s G].

Vowels are indicated by a _tehta_ above the following consonant.

What if there's no consonant immediately following the vowel? In that case, the vowel _tehta_ is placed on a carrier _tengwa_ [.t &#96;]. The carrier has no sound of its own; it just gives the _tehta_ a place to sit.

- [.t q2$&#96;N] &middot; [.s pedo] "speak"
- [.t xj%35^&#96;Bj$] &middot; [.s Gilthoniel]

For long vowels, the _andaith_ of course can't be used. Instead, the vowel _tehta_ is placed on a long carrier letter [.t ~]. This type of carrier is used even if there's a following consonant.

- [.t t~B7&#96;Bj$] &middot; [.s míriel]

### R, S, and Y

The _ómatehta_ mode uses two different letters for [.s R]: [.t 7] and [.t 6]. [.t 6] is used at the end of words, while [.t 7] is used elsewhere.

### Abbreviations

The _ómatehta_ mode uses the same abbreviations as the Mode of Beleriand, plus a few more. A bar below a _tengwa_ indicates that the letter is doubled. However, double [.s NN] and [.s MM] use the wavy line above instead—just like in the Mode of Beleriand, this indicates a preceding nasal sound.
