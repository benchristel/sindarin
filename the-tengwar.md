The _tengwar_ were invented by Fëanor in Aman, and so were first used to write Quenya. But Fëanor, always ambitious, didn't just devise an alphabet solely for his own language. He created a system so versatile that it could be adapted to *any* language. Thus when the exiled Noldor brought the _tengwar_ to Middle-earth, they were able to use the script to write Sindarin. By the Third Age there were multiple styles or "modes" for writing Sindarin with _tengwar_, each with its own spelling conventions.

## The Mode of Beleriand

The _Mode of Beleriand_ is the most ancient of the Sindarin tengwar styles. The letters correspond one-to-one with Sindarin sounds, as shown below:

### Vowels and Diphthongs

Long vowels were given an accent mark: [.t &#93;F] represented [.s á] or [.s â]. The Sindarin term for this is [.s andaith] "long-mark".

For diphthongs, the scribes used a _tengwa_ to represent the first vowel. A mark (_tehta_ in Quenya) above the _tengwa_ was often used for the second vowel. However, Tolkien notes in Appendix E that "the diphthongs were often written out in full", as [.t &#93;l] in the _tengwar_ transcription of _A Elbereth Gilthoniel_.

### Abbreviations

The early Sindarin scribes liked to abbreviate common letter com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tions. Double [.s NN] and [.s MM] were represented by doubling the curved "bow" of [.t 6] and [.t y], producing [.t 5] and [.t t]. An [.s N] or [.s M] before another consonant was abbreviated as a bar or wavy line above the consonant: [.t 1p] for [.s NT], [.t wP] for [.s MB], etc.

### The Complicated Matter of _W_

A mark like a flattened S (also used for the diphthong [.s AU]) might have been used for a following [.s W] sound: [.s Narwain] "January" might have been written [.t 6&#93;7ê&#93;Ö6]. In Appendix E, Tolkien mentions that this symbol was "required for the expression of <em>au</em>, <em>aw</em>," perhaps meaning that it was used only in that circumstance, and [.t n] was used elsewhere for [.s W].
For [.s GW], there is an additional layer of complication. The Noldor, on first encountering Sindarin, would likely have used [.t x] for [.s GW], since that spelling closely mirrors Quenya. [.s Gwirith] "April" might be written [.t x&#96;7&#96;3]. This ties in nicely with the use of [.t c] for [.s CHW], which Tolkien implies (but does not quite state) in Appendix E: <q><em>hwesta sindarinwa</em> [[.t o]] or <q>Grey-elven <em>hw</em></q> was so called because in Quenya [[.t c]] had the sound of <em>hw</em>, and distinct signs for <em>chw</em> and <em>hw</em> were not required.</q>

Thus, the possibilities for writing [.s GW] are:

- [.t x&#96;7&#96;3] &middot; [.s Gwirith]
- [.t sè&#96;7&#96;3] &middot; [.s Gwirith]
- [.t sn&#96;7&#96;3] &middot; [.s Gwirith]

Which of these was used is not certain.

For other consonant clusters ending in [.s W], there are only two possibilities: the [.t &nbsp;ê]-_tehta_ or the _tengwa_ [.t n].

- [.t 6&#93;7ê&#93;Ö6] &middot; [.s Narwain]
- [.t 6&#93;7n&#93;Ö6] &middot; [.s Narwain]

### Ambiguities

When writing in tengwar, keep in mind that the Elves didn't use our Roman alphabet, so they would have spelled Sindarin words according to their sound and not the letters we use to represent them. [.s Nef] ends with a "v" sound and so should be spelled [.t 6lr] in tengwar. Similarly, [.t m] is only used for [.s LH] when the single sound [.s LH] is meant. [.s Edhelharn], being a compound [.s Edhel] + [.s harn], would be spelt [.t l4lj9&#93;76].

## The _Ómatehta_ Mode

_Ómatehtar_ (Quenya for "vowel-signs") are the dots and curls above the letters in the Ring inscription. In LotR Appendix E they're referred to simply as _tehtar_, or "marks". They represent the vowels in many _tengwar_ modes.

_Ómatehtar_ were not used until late in Sindarin's history. The Sindarin _ómatehta_ mode is associated mainly with the Men of Gondor, and is sometimes called the Mode of Gondor.

The consonant letters follow mostly the same patterns in the Mode of Beleriand, but except for [.s C],  [.s CH], [.s G]. In Gondor, the letters [.t a], [.t s], and [.t d]  were used for writing the sounds _ch_ (as in _church_), _j_, and _sh_, which were common in the Westron language. Gondorians thus preferred to use [.t z], [.t c], and [.t x] for Sindarin [.s C], [.s CH], and [.s G].

What if there's no consonant immediately following the vowel? In that case, the vowel _tehta_ is placed on a carrier _tengwa_ [.t &#96;]. The carrier has no sound of its own; it just gives the _tehta_ a place to sit.

- [.t q2$&#96;N] &middot; [.s pedo] "speak"
- [.t xj%35^&#96;Bj$] &middot; [.s Gilthoniel]

For long vowels, the _andaith_ of course can't be used. Instead, the vowel _tehta_ is placed on a long carrier letter [.t ~]. This type of carrier is used even if there's a following consonant.

- [.t t~B7&#96;Bj$] &middot; [.s míriel]

### R, S, and Y

The _ómatehta_ mode uses two different letters for [.s R]: [.t 7] and [.t 6]. [.t 6] is used at the end of words, while [.t 7] is used elsewhere.

### Abbreviations

The _ómatehta_ mode uses the same abbreviations as the Mode of Beleriand, plus a few more. A bar below a _tengwa_ indicates that the letter is doubled. However, double [.s NN] and [.s MM] use the wavy line above instead—just like in the Mode of Beleriand, this indicates a preceding nasal sound.
