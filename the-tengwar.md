In its most ancient form, Sindarin was only written using
_cirth_ or runes. However, when the Noldor brought
the _tengwar_ to Middle-earth, the Sindar readily adopted
the new writing system.

The word _tengwar_ is Quenya, not Sindarin—owing to the fact
that the writing system is of Noldorin origin.
The Sindarin word for the _tengwar_ is [.s tîw], but you'll
rarely see this word outside of Sindarin texts. Most people
call the writing system by its Quenya name, regardless of
what language they're writing about. Many terms closely
associated with _tengwar_ (_telco_, _lúva_, _ómatehta_)
are also Quenya.

The great versatility of the _tengwar_ led to the development
of many different Sindarin modes. By the Third Age there were
at least three modes in use, each with its own spelling
conventions. This book covers the two most common ones.

## The Mode of Beleriand

The oldest Sindarin mode is that of Beleriand—the land where
the Teleri led by Elwë dwelt, and where the first encounter
between Sindarin and the _tengwar_ occurred. This mode uses
full _tengwar_ rather than _ómatehtar_ for vowels.

The letters of the Beleriand mode, shown in Figure 1,
correspond one-to-one with Sindarin sounds. Because the
letters of this mode represent Sindarin sounds, rather than
letters in our alphabet, you may want to refer back to
the chapter on pronunciation that starts <a href="#pronunciation" class="pageref"></a>.

You'll notice
many similarities to the Brogan mode <a href="#writing-english-with-tengwar" class="pageref"></a>. Notable differences include the use
of [.t 6] for N and [.t y] for M (as [.t 5] and [.t t] are used for
the doubled versions of these consonants) and [.t 7] for R.

Though most of the _tengwar_ are Noldorin in origin, the
letter [.t o] is a purely Sindarin invention, necessitated
by Sindarin's distinction between [.s HW] and [.s CHW], which
Quenya lacks. The Quenya name for this letter is _hwesta Sindarinwa_,
or "Sindarin HW".

### Vowels and Diphthongs

Long vowels were given an accent mark: [.t &#93;F] represented [.s á] or [.s â]. The Sindarin term for this is [.s andaith] "long-mark".

The two letters for [.s I] were used in different contexts. The
longer variant [.t ~B] was used for [.s I] before a vowel at the
beginning of a word, which has the sound of _Y_ in _yes_.
[.t \`B] was used elsewhere, and had the sound of _I_ in _machine_.

A dot was often placed above the letters for [.s I] and [.s A] to prevent
them from being mistaken for the stem or bow of an adjacent
letter: [.t &#93;T], [.t \`B], [.t ~B].

For diphthongs, the scribes used a _tengwa_ to represent the first vowel. A _tehta_ above this was often used for the second vowel. However, Tolkien notes in Appendix E that "the diphthongs were often written out in full", as [.t &#93;l] for [.s AE] in the _tengwar_ transcription of _A Elbereth Gilthoniel_. Perhaps this means that a diphthong like AI, normally abbreviated to [.t &#93;Ö], could also be written [.t &#93;\`B].

### Abbreviations

As shown in Figure 1, double [.s NN] and [.s MM] were represented by doubling the bow or _lúva_ of [.t 6] and [.t y], producing [.t 5] and [.t t]. An [.s N] or [.s M] before another consonant was abbreviated as a bar or wavy line above the consonant: [.t 1p] for [.s NT], [.t wP] for [.s MB], etc. This will no doubt feel familiar if you learned the English _tengwar_ modes in the preceding chapters. Note, however, that the other abbreviations used in the English modes do *not* occur in the Beleriand mode.

### The Complicated Matter of _W_

A mark like a flattened S (also used for the diphthong [.s AU]) might have been used for a following [.s W] sound: [.s Narwain] "January" might have been written [.t 6&#93;7ê&#93;Ö6]. In Appendix E, Tolkien mentions that this symbol was "required for the expression of <em>au</em>, <em>aw</em>," perhaps meaning that it was used only in that circumstance, and [.t n] was used elsewhere for [.s W].
For [.s GW], there is an additional layer of complication. The Noldor, on first encountering Sindarin, would likely have used [.t x] for [.s GW], since that spelling closely mirrors Quenya. [.s Gwirith] "April" might be written [.t x&#96;7&#96;3]. This ties in nicely with the use of [.t c] for [.s CHW], which Tolkien implies (but does not quite state) in Appendix E: <q><em>hwesta sindarinwa</em> [[.t o]] or <q>Grey-elven <em>hw</em></q> was so called because in Quenya [[.t c]] had the sound of <em>hw</em>, and distinct signs for <em>chw</em> and <em>hw</em> were not required.</q>

Thus, the possibilities for writing [.s GW] are:

- [.t x&#96;7&#96;3] &middot; [.s Gwirith]
- [.t sè&#96;7&#96;3] &middot; [.s Gwirith]
- [.t sn&#96;7&#96;3] &middot; [.s Gwirith]

Which of these was used is not certain.

For other consonant clusters ending in [.s W], there are only two possibilities: the [.t &nbsp;ê]-_tehta_ or the _tengwa_ [.t n].

- [.t 6&#93;7ê&#93;Ö6] &middot; [.s Narwain]
- [.t 6&#93;7n&#93;Ö6] &middot; [.s Narwain]

### Ambiguities

When writing in tengwar, keep in mind that the Elves didn't use our Roman alphabet, so they would have spelled Sindarin words according to their sound and not the letters we use to represent them. [.s Nef] ends with a "v" sound and so should be spelled [.t 6lr] in tengwar. Similarly, [.t m] is only used for [.s LH] when the single sound [.s LH] is meant. [.s Edhelharn], being a compound [.s Edhel] + [.s harn], would be spelt [.t l4lj9&#93;76]. The issue of spelling ambiguities is covered <a class="pageref" href="#splitting-up-letter-combinations"></a>.

## The _Ómatehta_ Mode

_Ómatehtar_ were not used until late in Sindarin's history. The Sindarin _ómatehta_ mode is associated mainly with the Men of Gondor, and is sometimes called the Mode of Gondor.

The consonant letters follow mostly the same patterns in the Mode of Beleriand, except for [.s C],  [.s CH], and [.s G]. In Gondor, the letters [.t a], [.t s], and [.t d]  were used for writing the sounds _ch_ (as in _church_), _j_, and _sh_, which were common in the Westron language. Gondorians thus preferred to use [.t z], [.t c], and [.t x] for Sindarin [.s C], [.s CH], and [.s G].

Vowels are indicated by a _tehta_ above the following consonant.

What if there's no consonant immediately following the vowel? In that case, the vowel _tehta_ is placed on a carrier _tengwa_ [.t &#96;]. The carrier has no sound of its own; it just gives the _tehta_ a place to sit.

- [.t q2$&#96;N] &middot; [.s pedo] "speak"
- [.t xj%35^&#96;Bj$] &middot; [.s Gilthoniel]

For long vowels, the _andaith_ of course can't be used. Instead, the vowel _tehta_ is placed on a long carrier letter [.t ~]. This type of carrier is used even if there's a following consonant.

- [.t t~B7&#96;Bj$] &middot; [.s míriel]

### R, S, and Y

The _ómatehta_ mode uses two different letters for [.s R]: [.t 7] and [.t 6]. [.t 6] is used at the end of words, while [.t 7] is used elsewhere.

### Abbreviations

The _ómatehta_ mode uses the same abbreviations as the Mode of Beleriand, plus a few more. A bar below a _tengwa_ indicates that the letter is doubled. However, double [.s NN] and [.s MM] use the wavy line above instead—just like in the Mode of Beleriand, this indicates a preceding nasal sound.
