Tolkien delighted in "tasting" languages. It was his way
of exploring the beauty of a language without needing to
learn all the fiddly grammar rules. He wrote:

> Gothic was the first [language] to take me by storm, to
> move my heart. [. . .] I have since mourned the loss of
> Gothic literature. I did not then. The contemplation of
> the vocabulary in _A Primer of the Gothic Language_ was
> enough [. . . .] I tried to invent Gothic words.
>
> I have, in this peculiar sense, studied ("tasted" would be
> better) other languages since. Of all save one among them
> the most overwhelming pleasure was provided by Finnish,
> and I have never quite got over it.

> —J.R.R. Tolkien, _The Monsters and the Critics p. 192_

This chapter endeavors to give you a "taste" of Sindarin—to
whet your appetite for the language and give you a
sense of what Sindarin is all about.

## A Brief History of Elvish Languages

The first Elves awoke before there was a Sun or a Moon. They
found themselves by
the shores of a great lake, which in the Quenya language
of later days was called *Cuiviénen*, the Water of
Awakening.
The first word they spoke, according to later Elven lore,
was _ele!_—an exclamation of wonder and delight that they
uttered upon first seeing the stars. They called themselves
_kwendī_, meaning "those who speak", since they knew of no
other beings that could use language.

When the Vala Arômez (often called _Oromë_) met the Elves and told them of Aman, the abode of the Valar beyond the sea, some Elves wished to go there and some were afraid to make the journey. Those who refused the journey were called _abarī_ ("refusers"). They were lost in the wilds of Middle-earth and play small part in its later history. Those who heeded Oromë and marched across Middle-earth to the shores of the Great Sea were called _edeloī_ ("travelers"). The Quenya word _eldar_ is a descendant of this term, as is the Sindarin [.s edhil]. Both words came to mean simply "elves".

During the journey toward the Sea, the _eldar_ were sundered yet again. The Vanyar and Noldor clans, who arrived at the shore first, hastened across the Sea to Aman. Those who tarried behind, the Teleri, waited at the shore, torn between their love for Middle-earth and their desire to cross the sea. Before they could begin the sea voyage, their leader, Elwë, crossed the path of Melian, a Maia. He fell at once in love with her and for many years they remained under an enchantment in the forest of Nan Elmoth. The other Teleri could not find him, and many refused to cross the Sea without their lord. And so they remained in Middle-earth.

Two hundred years later, Elwë reappeared, and with Melian as his queen reassumed rulership of the Teleri. As the long, sunless years passed and the Teleri and Noldor remained apart, their speech gradually changed. The language of the Noldor became the speech known in the Third Age as Quenya, while the Teleri came to speak a language that had as yet no name, for since their separation from the Noldor they heard no speech except their own and needed no word to distinguish it. If they had occasion to refer to their language, they would likely have called it [.s edhellen] ("Elvish").

But [.s edhellen] was not fated to dwell alone in the forests forever.
The Noldor returned to Middle-earth, and it was with blood on their hands—they had taken ships by force from the Teleri who had traveled to Aman, and killed many of them in the process. When Elwë learned that the Noldor had slain his kindred, he banned their language Quenya from his realm. The language of Elwë became the language of all the _eldar_ of Middle-earth, but its contact with the Noldor left its mark, and ever after the language bore a Quenya name: _Sindarin_, or "Grey-elven".

In Frodo's day the Elves west of the Misty Mountains still spoke Sindarin, and in their houses it could often be heard as they lifted their voices in song:

> [.s A! Elbereth, Gilthoniel!]
> [.s Mi 'aladhremmin derthiel]
> [.s Chae ennorath, sí ][.s.salo renim ][.s ui]
> [.s Gîl lín or 'Aear Annui.]
>
> (O Elbereth Starkindler,
> Having dwelt far away in tree-woven
> Middle-earth, we still recall forever
> Thy stars above the Western Sea.)

## Features of Sindarin

Sindarin is an earthy language, akin to but unlike its sibling Quenya. While Quenya flourished in Aman, the abode of the angelic Valar, Sindarin was confined to the forests and caves of Middle-earth. Its recompense was an understanding, woven into its words, of the significance of earthly things like mountains and trees, and also of their finiteness and ultimate mortality. The changefulness of Sindarin echoes the change of mortal lands.

This "changefulness" deserves further description, because it is one of the things that makes Sindarin so fascinating and challenging to study. Basically, a word in Sindarin can wear many disguises, changing its form in a kaleidoscope of ways. Take, for example, the phrase "the letter": in Sindarin this would be _i dêw_. To form the plural, English simply adds an _-s_: "the letters". But in Sindarin, the plural form changes completely: "the letters" would be _i thîw_! So if you saw these phrases in a Sindarin text and wanted to look up the word, where in the dictionary should you look? Under _dêw_ or _thîw_? It turns out that this is a trick question, because *both* of these forms are "mutated" versions of the basic word _têw_—which is what an Elf would likely say if you asked "how do you say &lsquo;letter&rsquo; in Sindarin?"

This system of *consonant mutations* is one of Sindarin's
most iconic features. Mutations are grammatical rules that
change the first letter of a word under certain conditions.

> [.s Cîr tollen ammen] "Ships have come for us"
> [.s ach ú-aníron gîr] "but I do not desire ships"
> [.s i ven i chîr hollen anim] "the path of the ships is closed to me"

In the example above, you'll notice that the word for
"ships" is variously rendered *cîr*, *gîr*, and *chîr*. The
rules of consonant mutations tell you when to use each
spelling.

The plural form of nouns is marked by internal changes in
the noun itself, rather than by a suffix (like the English
plural suffix *-s*). For example, the plural of [.s adan] "human"
is [.s edain] "humans"; the plural of [.s aran] "king" is
[.s erain].

## Quenya and Sindarin

Within Tolkien's legendarium, Sindarin contrasts primarily
with the High-Elven language Quenya. Although Tolkien imagined over a dozen languages
to fill out every corner of Middle-earth, it was to these two
that he dedicated most of his artistic energy. While the other languages
have only a smattering of vocabulary, Sindarin and Quenya
have thousands of words each.

For this reason, when you encounter an Elvish name or phrase in
Tolkien's works, it is almost certain to be either Sindarin
or Quenya. However, Tolkien generally doesn't specify
which language he's using when he introduces an Elvish phrase.
Therefore, the first lesson every student of Elvish must
learn is how to tell these two languages apart.
They have very different grammars and rules for word formation, so if
you mix them up, you'll end up very confused!

Fortunately for us, Sindarin and Quenya look different enough
that it's easy to learn to tell them apart. Here are some
Sindarin words with their Quenya and English translations:

  <tr class="head">

    <td>early spring (season)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="s">dû</td>
    <td><em>ló</em></td>
    <td>night</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Just from that list, you might be starting to get a sense
of the flavor of each language. But if you prefer to
rules to vague feelings—here are some rules you can use to tell
the languages apart:

!!bullets

- Though it's not a hard-and-fast rule, Quenya words tend
  to end with a vowel (A, E, I, O, or U), while Sindarin
  words tend to end with a consonant.
- If you see an E with two dots over, (*ë*), you can be
  100% certain the word is Quenya.
- If you see a circumflex accent (e.g. â), you can be 100%
  certain the word is Sindarin. (Assuming it's Elvish at all;
  a few of Tolkien's non-Elvish languages use the circumflex,
  notably the Númenórean language Adunaic, the "Common Speech" Westron,
  the Black Speech of Mordor, and Valarin, the language of the Valar).
- If the word begins with *D*, *B*, or *G*, it's Sindarin.
  Quenya uses these letters, but only in the middle of words.
- If you see *TH*, *DH*, or *PH*, it's Sindarin.
- If you see the letters *Q* or *X*, the word is Quenya.
