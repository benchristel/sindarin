# A Diachronic Overview of Sindarin

The most ancient Elvish language, Primitive Quendian, seems to be often conflated with Common Eldarin in the Etymologies (the latter is properly the latest common ancestor of Sindarin and Quenya). This may be with good reason; the comparative method of historical linguistics only allows ancestor languages to be derived if multiple descendent languages are recorded. The only data that could distinguish PQ from CE would have to come from Avarin and perhaps Nandorin languages, descended from PQ but not CE. Tolkien may have imagined that Avarin sources were scarce and so the precise developments between PQ and CE could not with certainty be determined.

The term Old Noldorin, which seems on its surface to refer to an ancestor of Noldorin at one point in time, is actually used in the Etymologies to refer to a sequence of stages in the development of Exilic Noldorin (later Classical Sindarin). We can therefore speak of "early Old Sindarin" and "late Old Sindarin", and I will use these terms to refer to the earliest and latest points in the period of phonological development that Tolkien calls Old Noldorin.

I will use the name Common Telerin to refer to the latest common ancestor of (Old) Sindarin and Telerin.

## Changes from Primitive Quendian to Common Eldarin

- final -ī (a common plural suffix) may have been shortened - the only examples of Avarin and Nandorin words we have show short -i in the plural. It seems that some other final vowels may not have shortened, however - they may have persisted as late as Common Telerin or Old Sindarin. Cf. the many OS infinitives in -óbe, indicative of an older final -ā that was shielded from shortening by the suffix -be and became ō in OS.
- j became i intervocalically or before a consonant

## Changes from Common Eldarin to Common Telerin

- kw became p

## Changes from Common Telerin to Old Sindarin

- loss of -h-, initially and intervocalically - compare the development of HEKE: OS `Ekla-mbar` vs. T `hekla` shows that this change happened no earlier than CT.
- Stops t, p, k were aspirated after a consonant.
- De-palatalization of stops: kjelepe (-ē) became kelepe in OS.
- the infinitive suffix -be was introduced
- long ā became ō non-finally (maybe with other conditions? see Salo)
- long final vowels shortened (if they had not already shortened by the CT stage)

## Changes within Old Sindarin (called Old Noldorin in the Etymologies)

- z -> i, cf. Ezde -> Eide
- Intervocalic `s` became `h`
- i-affection? Eide -> !Iide -> Īde

## Changes from Old Sindarin to Classical Sindarin

Sequence I:
- i-affection
- final vowels were lost in polysyllables
- final syllabic -r, -l gained a vowel

Sequence II:
- voiced stops become fricatives after a vowel
- unvoiced stops voice after a vowel

Sequence III:
- aspirates became fricatives
- affricates kkh, tth, pph simplify to ch, th, ph.
- phs -> chs (Salo 4.82)
- ls -> lth (Salo 4.83)
- ch became h when absolutely initial

Sequence IV:
- absolutely initial nasalized stops denasalized

Unknown Sequence:
- clusters in s- deleted the s-. Salo says this happened unconditionally; I wonder if that is true. All the examples he cites show initial s- disappearing. Find an example of this happening medially.
- ?voiceless nasals became voiced (TODO: find out if voiceless nasals in ON are attested or if Salo made them up. HKF makes no mention of them in his OS article, and Ety:SMAL does not indicate voiceless nasals on e.g. asmalinde > ammalinde.)
