How does CE `arātā` lead to both S `arth` and `arod`? Stress difference? Salo 240.

How does BERÉK lose the first vowel before the CE stage?

Why was the first vowel of CE karáni not lost (Caran)? Salo explicitly states that the second vowel was stressed.

There may be a misplaced sound change (ja -> ji) on Salo 43. The examples given look like middle Sindarin and the OS examples in the lexicon don't show this change. C.f. the entry for Ivon on 353.

etkelē → ekkʰele ‣ ektʰele "source". ekkʰele is expected here, but OS has ektʰele instead. Could be that the first syllable is stressed, which causes the tk -> kt metathesis?

spanâjā → spʰanôia ‣ spʰanúia "cloudy".

etlednā → etlenda ‣ etlenna "exiled"

Salo disagrees with himself on whether initial ŋl became ŋgl or gl. On p. 38 he states that initial ŋl became gl and gives _glaw_ as an example. But _ŋglô_ is given as the OS reflex of _glaw_ on p. 257. No source is cited in the glossary and the OS form is marked as hypothetical, so it seems plausible that it's the glossary that's wrong. c.f. entry in Etymologies for KAL, which lists `g'lā` as the CE form of _glaw_ (possibly implying earlier `galā` from the root GAL?) Not sure where Salo gets `ŋalâ` from, since `galâ` also generates _glô_ in OS and Hisweloke only lists the Etymologies as the source for _glaw_.

> The CE form of _gling_ is given as _liŋgi_ on Salo 257. This seems wrong, since the sound changes give no indication of how the initial _g_ could arise from such a form, and the listed root is "G-LIŋG". However, this seeming inconsistency is repeated on page 258, in the entries for _glóren_ and _glóriel_. RESOLVED: Reference to the Etymologies clarifies this somewhat. The G- was apparently gained subsequent to the split of Noldorin from Q(u)enya. I'm not sure how we know it should be kept in the conversion to Sindarin.

> CE awatʰā should change to OS autʰa, according to Salo 240, but does not. RESOLVED - conjectured environment for Salo 4.3 was too strict. Expanded to change `awa` to `aw`. The reconstructed OS form is `awtʰa`, not `autʰa`, but other reflexes of CS `au` show `aw` at this stage. c.f. OS `kʰawda` < CE `kʰagdā` (haudh), Salo 4.25.

> How did the vowel change in CE kaem -> OS kai? c.f. kaolō -> kaulo (caul), ndaer -> ndair (daer) RESOLVED: there seemed to be a missing sound change that would cause this. `e` and `o` are already raised when long, so it's not that much of a stretch to say they might raise in long syllables in general.

> Why was the second vowel of kárani lost (Carn)? Similarly, why was the second vowel of koronē lost? RESOLVED: expanded the environment for the pre-CE change that causes vowel deletion.
