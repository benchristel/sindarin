#          narwâ "fiery red" (NAR1; the wording in this entry in Etym may seem to suggest that this is a Quenya word, but the long final vowel indicates that it is meant to be Primitive Elvish.)
#          natsai "gore" (This is not the pl. of Sindarin naith, but an archaic pl. form that sg. naith is derived from.) (SNAS/SNAT)
#          naukâ adjective "especially applied to things that though in themselves full-grown were smaller or shorter than their kind, and were hard, twisted or ill-shapen" (WJ:413)
#          nauþe "imagination" (NOWO; the letter þ represents th as in English thing. This sound apparently did not occur in the most primitive language [though the aspirate TH did], so nauþe must rather be archaic Quenya. Cf. also the form of the root, suggesting that at the oldest stage, the initial syllable was *nou- rather than nau-.)

#          Olo(s)-fantur > "Noldorin"/Sindarin Olfannor and Quenya Olofantur, names of the Vala Lórien (ÓLOS; because of the f in fantur, a sound not occurring in the primitive language, this must be taken as archaic Quenya.)

#          ruk- one of the "ancient forms" of the stem RUKU, that yielded the word Orch (Orc) in Sindarin. Other forms include rauk-, uruk-, urk(u), runk-, rukut/s; also the "strengthened stem" gruk- and the "elaborated" guruk-, ñguruk (the latter by combination with a distinct stem NGUR "horror", WJ:415). None of these derivatives are clearly glossed, though urku (or uruku) is said to have yielded Quenya urko, vague in meaning in the lore of the Blessed Realm ("bogey"), but later recognized as a cognate of Sindarin Orch.

#          ?wâ-delô (CE) *"Away-goer", a name made in Beleriand for those who finally departed from Middle-earth. Also awa-delo, awâ-delo. (WJ:360, 363)

But in the Etymologies, Quenya vanya is said to come from banjâ (BAN), and in his last years Tolkien apparently returned to this idea: in PM:402, it is said that "of old" the name Vanyar was Banyai (evidently ancient Quenya for primitive *banjâi).

#          we3ê "manhood, vigour" (WEG; given this root, this word must be proto-Quenya for earlier *wegê)

#          wedâ "bond" (WED)
#          wegô "man", in compounds -wego with short final vowel (WEG)
#          wegtê ("weg-tê") (Unglossed; Christopher Tolkien therefore thinks the entry WEG "was left unfinished", but this is rather the primitive form of the element -waith, -weith in Sindarin Forodweith, Forodwaith "Northmen" mentioned just before.) (WEG)
#          -wego, -weg (compound form) "man", frequent element in masculine names (WEG)
#          wei (archaic element meaning "wind, weave") (WEY)
#          weirê "Weaver", the archaic form that yielded Quenya Vairë, name of a Valië (stem WEY "weave", LR:398). Note, however, that Tolkien in a later source derives Vairë from a stem WIR and states that it is A-infixed to express "Ever-weaving"; this would point to a primitive form *Wairê (not explicitly mentioned). (VT39:10)
#          wen- "maiden" (WEN/WENED)
#          wilmâ "air, lower air" (distinct from the 'upper' air of the stars, or the 'outer'). Changed by Tolkien from wilwâ. (WIL)
#          [windi "blue-grey, pale blue or grey" (WIN/WIND)]
#          windiâ "pale blue" (It is uncertain whether Tolkien rejected this word or not.) (WIN/WIND; according to VT46:21 the final i is marked with a diacritical sign indicating that it functions as a semi-vowel, so we may also read *windjâ)
#          wingê "foam, crest of wave, crest" (WIG)
#          [winjâ "evening" (WIN/WIND)]
#          [winta- "fade" (WIN/WIND; see VT46:21 concerning the stress)]
#          wô, prefix wo- "together", a dual adverb "together", referring to the junction of two things, or groups, in a pair or whole. (WJ:361) The Etymologies likewise has wô, wo "together" (evidently PQ, since it yielded CE wa), but nothing is there said about this being exclusively dual. (WÔ)
#          Wolwê (CE) hypothetical early form of Olwë; Tolkien points out that this should rather have yielded Volwë in Telerin, so this reconstruction may be doubtful (PM:357)
