# _Mae govannen!_

This book is about Sindarin, an Elvish language invented by
J.R.R. Tolkien as part of his fictional world of
Middle-earth. Actually, to say that Sindarin comes
from Middle-earth is a bit backwards; Tolkien was inventing
Elvish languages long before he ever dreamed
up _hobbits_ or the Ring or any of the rest of it. It would
be closer to the truth to say that Middle-earth comes from
Sindarin, for the Elvish languages were the real inspiration
for all the rest of Tolkien's legendarium. As Tolkien
himself wrote in a letter to his publisher,

> The invention of languages is the foundation. The <q>stories</q> were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in <q>Elvish</q>.[.cite letters 221]

Language was Tolkien's first love, and he considered the
invention of language to be inseparable from his writing.
After all, what is a story without a language
that can tell it? And what is a language without a story to
tell?

And what is either one, without people who remember it?

> [.s A Elbereth! Gilthoniel!]
> [.s Mí epholar sí, derthiel]
> [.s Vi ndor haer hen galaðui,]
> [.s Gilgalad gaear annui.]

> _We still remember, we who dwell_
> _In these far lands beneath the trees_
> _Thy starlight on the western seas._

## Why study Sindarin?

The _Lord of the Rings_ is aglitter with Sindarin names and
phrases: _Caras Galadhon_, _Amon Amarth_, _Minas Tirith_,
_Galadriel_. You can appreciate these words for their sound
alone, but knowing a bit of Elvish will
reveal the incredible depth of the stories behind them,
depth that can only be vaguely glimpsed by those who aren't
yet acquainted with the language.

But perhaps a more immediately compelling reason is that
Sindarin is simply beautiful. Tolkien delighted in "the moment of
association between sound and sense" and his words
have the feel of having been polished by a master craftsman:
they *sound* like what they mean.
Tolkien describes the peculiar feeling of inventing the word
*lint* in childhood, with the meaning "quick", and how he
was struck by the way the sound seemed to fit the meaning.
(The word survives, slightly modified, in Sindarin: [.s lim].)
His keen sense of the music of words is evident
everywhere in Sindarin.

Learning Sindarin might even help you learn other languages.
The hardest
part of learning any foreign language is putting aside the
habits of your native tongue, and Sindarin provides ample
opportunity to unlearn English. Indeed, if you study Elvish
enough, English may seem the more peculiar language.

And of course, you probably want to actually *use* the
language for something. You can certainly use Sindarin to give an
Elvish flavor to roleplaying campaigns or Tolkien fanfiction.
If you study very hard, you might even be able to use it
for journaling or secret communication (though Sindarin
naturally lacks vocabulary for modern inventions like
cars and phones). And of course, you can write poetry, and
enjoy the poetry of others, which you can find in abundance
on the Web.

## About this book

This textbook is designed as an introductory course in the
Sindarin language. The lessons progress gradually from
easy topics to more complex ones, but at the end of each
lesson you will have learned a small piece of the language
that you can immediately start using. There are fill-in-the-blank
exercises at the end of each lesson so you can test yourself
and practice using the language.

The book is divided into two groups of lessons:

- **Writing and Speaking**, which covers the _tengwar_
   alphabet, some basic phrases, and pronunciation. If you
   read this section, you'll be able to write secret notes in the
   Elvish alphabet, and pronounce the names and phrases
   in _The Lord of the Rings_.
- **Sindarin Grammar**, which describes the rules for putting
   Sindarin words together into sentences. In this section,
   you'll learn both conversational and
   literary Sindarin, and by the end you'll be able to say
   and write anything that can be said or written in the
   language.

If you plan on reading section two and don't care about
learning to write in _tengwar_, you can skip most of
section one. Please do read at least the pronunciation section,
though. There isn't much point in being able to assemble
sentences in a language you can't pronounce.

## One big asterisk

Now, before you run off and buy your ticket to Middle-earth,
I need to burst your bubble a tiny bit. The truth is...
you can't *really* learn to speak Elvish.

What I mean by that is that there are some sentences that can
be translated into any real-world language, but which
simply *don't work* in Sindarin. A sentence that you might
toss off casually in English, like "my computer's been
acting strange recently", becomes a bewildering puzzle in
Sindarin. If you really wanted to translate it, you'd
first have to invent a word for "computer", since of course
the Elves didn't have computers, and then you'd have to
figure out appropriate Sindarin idioms for "acting strange"
and "recently". With that done, you'd have to choose the
right verb tense to convey the idea that your computer's
strange behavior started at some undefined point in the past
and has continued up to the present time (hint: there is no
such verb form in Sindarin). The result likely wouldn't be
intelligible without a couple of paragraphs of English
explaining it, and even then it would be clunky and ugly—not
the sort of thing an Elf would say at all!

There is no need to despair, however. In time you may come to
see the limitations of Sindarin as a strength rather
than a weakness. When something is hard to phrase in
Sindarin it's sometimes because it simply doesn't fit into
Tolkien's world, but if you learn to cut away the indirection
of modern speech you can often phrase your meaning in a
surprisingly Elvish way. "My computer's been acting strange recently"
becomes [.s I balannir-e-deithad nîn ce fíriel. Thoss tôl anim.] "My writing-<em>palantír</em> may be dying. I am afraid."
Sindarin forces you to simplify your words and get to the
heart of the matter—a valuable skill no matter what language
you write in.


One of the obstacles to learning Elvish is Tolkien's
inconvenient habit of never *finishing* anything.
For him, the joy of language creation was in constantly
tinkering and reworking things, so when he left this world
his languages were still incomplete and, in many places,
inconsistent.

An extreme example of this inconsistency is the Quenya word
_lá_. In 1960 Tolkien wrote that _lá_ meant "yes". Simple enough.
But ten years later, he wrote that _lá_ meant "no"!
If we're going to use
Quenya ourselves, we need to pick one or the other, but it's
not clear which is better. (Quenya is a
separate Elvish language from Sindarin, and is beyond the
scope of this book, but similar situations arise in Sindarin
too.)

The gaps in our knowledge also pose problems. Sindarin
lacks Tolkien-made words for things as basic as "please",
"thank you", and "toilet". The grammar is also full of
holes: Ask a Sindarin expert how to say something like
"If I had known about it, I would have wanted you to go
with me" and you'll likely receive a blank stare. Forget
the conditional "if"—we're not even sure how to translate
"with" in that sentence!

Fortunately for us, many people have undertaken the monumental work
of resolving these gaps, often
by comparing Sindarin with other Elvish languages, or
by looking for patterns in Tolkien's use of various grammar
rules. In doing so, they can give us a *possible* view of
what Sindarin *might* have been
like *if* Tolkien had been interested in "finishing" it.

With so many ifs, ands, and buts, it should be clear that
this reconstructed "Neo-Sindarin" is by no means Tolkien
canon or verifiably "correct" in any way. To put it another
way: when we use Sindarin, we have to make
a hard choice: the
more words we reconstruct, the more we can say, but the less
likely the resulting language is to resemble anything that
Tolkien might have envisioned.

## On Reconstructed Words

Different authors choose to do different amounts of
reconstruction when writing in Sindarin. The prevailing
view is that reconstruction is permissible but words that
are not truly Tolkien's must be marked with an
asterisk (\*). This book follows that convention.

All reconstructions are just educated guesses about what
words *might* exist in Sindarin, so sometimes when a new
piece of Tolkien's writing is published, it proves some
reconstructed word to be flat-out wrong. But when the
"wrong" word is already widespread among Tolkien
fans, it is difficult (not to mention undesirable) to get
everyone to stop using it.

For example, after the _Lord of the Rings_ films came out,
everyone started using [.s le hannon] to mean "thank you" in
Sindarin, because that's what the characters in the movie
said. But [.s le hannon] doesn't hold up
to careful analysis: according to the normal rules of Sindarin,
"thank you" is more likely to be [.s le annon]. The problem with that
is that [.s le annon] also means "I give (to) you".

I personally feel that it is important for new students of
Sindarin to learn "wrong" phrases like [.s le hannon]—
otherwise, a lot of the Sindarin on the web, and a
large portion of the _Lord of the Rings_ film dialogue,
won't be intelligible. In many cases, there is no viable
alternative to a misguided reconstruction: Sindarin speakers
are simply *not* going to stop saying [.s le hannon] until a
genuine Tolkien translation of "thank you" is published—and
there is no guarantee that that will ever happen.

But it's just as important to
learn that [.s le hannon] is not a phrase that will hold up
to the rigorous analysis most reconstructions are subject
to. Because of this, I have chosen to include deprecated,
hand-wavy, misguided, or otherwise wrong reconstructions
in this course, but to mark them with a dagger (&dagger;).
Use such words with caution, and if
someone calls you out and says your Sindarin is "wrong", be
ready to say "I know".
