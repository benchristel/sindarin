# _Mae govannen!_

This book is about Sindarin, an Elvish language invented by
J.R.R. Tolkien as part of his fictional world of
Middle-earth. Actually, to say that Sindarin comes
from Middle-earth is a bit backwards; Tolkien was inventing
Elvish (and Gnomish!) languages long before he ever dreamed
up _hobbits_ or the Ring or any of the rest of it. It would
be closer to the truth to say that Middle-earth comes from
Sindarin, for the Elvish languages were the real inspiration
for all the rest of Tolkien's legendarium. As Tolkien
himself wrote in a letter to his publisher,

> The invention of languages is the foundation. The
> <q>stories</q> were made rather to provide a world for the
> languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and
> the story follows. I should have preferred to write in
> <q>Elvish</q>.[.cite letters 221]

Language was Tolkien's first love; for him, language was
the essence of mythos. What is a story without a language
that can tell it? What is language without a story to tell?

This book tells the story of the language of the Elves of
Middle-earth.

## Why study Sindarin?

You've already got one reason: the languages were the seed
of Tolkien's invented world. Knowing a bit of Elvish will
reveal the incredible depth to Tolkien's stories, depth
that can only be vaguely glimpsed by those who aren't
acquainted with his languages.

But perhaps a more immediately compelling reason is that
Sindarin is simply beautiful. Tolkien delighted in "the moment of
association between sound and sense" and all of his words
have the feel of having been polished by a master craftsman.
Tolkien describes the peculiar feeling of inventing the word
*lint* in childhood, with the meaning "quick", and how he
was struck by the way the sound seemed to fit the meaning.
(The word survives, slightly modified, in Sindarin: [.s lim].)
His keen sense of the music of language is evident
everywhere in Sindarin.

Learning Sindarin might even help you learn other languages.
The hardest
part of learning any foreign language is putting aside the
habits of your native tongue, and Sindarin provides ample
opportunity to unlearn English. Indeed, if you study Elvish
enough, English may seem the more peculiar language.

If you've read this far, you probably want to actually *use* the
language for something. You can certainly use Sindarin to give an
Elvish flavor to roleplaying campaigns or Tolkien fanfiction.
If you study very hard, you might even be able to use it
for journaling or secret communication (though Sindarin
lacks vocabulary for the activities and artifacts of
modern humans). And of course, you can write poetry, and
enjoy the poetry of others, which can be found in abundance
on the Web.

- One Big Asterisk
  - this book isn't about *Tolkien's* Sindarin
  - Tolkien's Sindarin was:
    - not designed to be used by anyone but Tolkien and the characters in his books
    - not complete
    - constantly evolving
  - This book presents a version of Sindarin that:
    - can be learned and used by anyone (though we won't cover the breadth of language-use situations that a foreign-language course would).
    - has a complete grammar capable of expressing anything (as long as the words exist in the Sindarin vocabulary)
    - is fixed at one point in time

- our relationship to Elvish languages is analogous to our relationship to nature
- by developing a personal and communal philosophy of how best to learn about and work with the Elvish languages, we can
  develop and clarify our own attitudes toward both the natural world and human institutions.
  - preservation?
    - don't interfere at all
    - precludes casual enjoyment
    - values: "knowing that it's there"
  - conservation?
    - values: sustainable economic benefit, recreation
  - investigation?
    - scientific inquiry
    - values: knowledge as an end in itself, or applied to other fields

# _Mae govannen!_

If you've picked up this book, I assume I don't need to introduce you to J.R.R. Tolkien. Maybe you've read _The Hobbit_ or _The Lord of the Rings_. Maybe both. Perhaps you've even delved into the _Silmarillion_ or the _History of Middle-earth_ series... or maybe you've only read the first few chapters of _The Lord of the Rings_ and put it down wondering what all the hype is about. That was my situation, years ago.

I first picked up The _Lord of the Rings_ at the age of twelve or thirteen, and found it to be a merciless slog, devoid of the humor that made _The Hobbit_ so delightful. But my friends were all raving about it—I couldn't just *not* read it. So I decided to cheat: I flipped through to the back of the book, to see how it ended.

What confronted me was not a climactic duel between Frodo and Sauron, but a hundred-odd pages worth of Appendices, filled with histories and genealogies and calendars, and above all *languages*. The Appendices gave me the sense that Tolkien's real goal with _The Lord of the Rings_ was not to tell the story of Frodo or Sauron but *to create the world in which those stories could be told*. I began reading Tolkien with a new purpose: to discover Middle-earth. My reward was immeasurable.

What I discovered was what many others have discovered: Tolkien invented languages. Marvelous, intricate, beautiful languages. The Elvish greeting _Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo_ isn't just pretty non&shy;sense—Tolkien worked out the grammar and history of the language (Quenya) in incredible detail. Despite appearing mostly in the Appendices, the languages were not an afterthought: they predated and in fact inspired the invention of Middle-earth. As Tolkien wrote in a letter to his publisher,

> The invention of languages is the foundation. The <q>stories</q> were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in <q>Elvish</q>.[.cite letters 221]

In light of such strong statements, it's clear that to understand Tolkien's work we need to share, or at least acknowledge, his passion for language.

However, Tolkien never shared this passion readily. He was always rather shy and self-deprecating about his language-creation habit, calling it a "secret vice" and a "mad hobby"[.cite letters 8]. He never sought to publish an Elvish grammar or dictionary—perhaps because he thought no one would be interested, but also because he loved the total creative freedom he had as a language inventor. Publishing information about Elvish would have forced him to get the languages into a "final" form and then stop working on them, and that was something he could never bring himself to do. For Tolkien, the fun of invented languages was in creating and re-creating, not in using a "finished" product.

Of course, we non-Tolkien people can't experience the joy of *creating* the Elvish languages. But we can *discover* them, and since our eyes are newly opened to Middle-earth, our experience will be fresher and keener than even the experience of a creator.

## Tolkien's Languages

Tolkien imagined many different languages being spoken in Arda[.note The name of Tolkien's fictional world, as a whole. _Middle-earth_ is properly the name of only one continent in that world.], but he really developed only two of them: the Elvish tongues **Quenya** and **Sindarin**. Quenya and Sindarin are sibling languages—they developed from a common ancestor, **Eldarin**, much as French and Spanish both developed from Latin. Tolkien worked out the evolution of each language in some detail, and this historical consistency is a huge help when trying to decipher the languages. Since Quenya and Sindarin are related we can use what we know about one to make educated guesses about the grammar and vocabulary of the other.

The Elvish languages are not designed to mirror any particular real-world languages, but Tolkien drew inspiration from the real languages he knew and loved. Quenya's abundant <em>L</em>s, rolled <em>R</em>s, and vowels echo Finnish and Latin:

> _Ai! laurië lantar lassi súrinen,_
> _Yéni únótimë ve rámar aldaron!_
> _Yéni ve lintë yuldar avánier_
> _mi oromardi lisse-miruvóreva [. . .]_[.note _The Fellowship of the Ring_, p. 394]

Sindarin, by contrast, was inspired by Tolkien's first love, Welsh. Most words end in a consonant, and the hard consonants **T**, **P**, and **K** favored by Quenya were often "softened" to **D**, **B**, and **G**. Sindarin also has the sound **TH**, which was replaced by **S** in Quenya.

> _A Elbereth Gilthoniel,_
> _silivren penna míriel_
> _o menel aglar elenath!_
> _Na-chaered palan-díriel_
> _o galadhremmin ennorath,_
> _Fanuilos, le linnathon,_
> _nef aear, sí nef aearon!_[.note _The Fellowship of the Ring_, p. 250]

This book is about Sindarin—though I refer frequently to Quenya words and constructions that help shed light on Sindarin.

## Learning Tolkien's Languages

Beginner-friendly guides to Elvish are often structured as language courses: they start out with some basic phrases and vocabulary, building up from there with examples of sentences and dialogue. By the end of the course, you have an understanding of the grammar and a feel for how to use the language in your own compositions.

The problem is, Tolkien never planned to make his languages usable—he was more interested in just making up words and imagining how they changed over time. His linguistic notes reflect this: they're full of beautiful words and historical details, but short on practical advice to language-learners.

This lack of practical source material means that we'll never be fluent in Sindarin—not as long as we stick to Tolkien canon. We can try to make Sindarin into a fully-usable language, but that requires creating new words and grammar that Tolkien never imagined and likely would not have approved of.

So if we want to "learn Tolkien's Elvish", we're left with a dilemma. If we work only from Tolkien's examples, we don't have enough material to make a usable language. We've "learned Tolkien" but we haven't "learned Elvish". If we try to fill in the gaps, we end up with a non-canon language. We've "learned Elvish" but disregarded Tolkien.

You might be wondering at this point which path you'd rather take. The purpose of this book is to make it so that you don't have to decide once and for all. You can learn about Tolkien's writings, or about how we might "complete" Sindarin, as you like. I describe both possibilities. The book is divided into sections to make it clear where one type of investigation ends and the next begins.

The first section, **Roots**, describes the hard core of Tolkien's Sindarin—the parts of the language about which we're relatively certain, and which survived many, many cycles of Tolkien's ceaseless revision. Examples from _The Lord of the Rings_ provide most of the data, though I also refer to Tolkien's posthumously-published notes when they show that some feature of the language stayed constant throughout his life. Reading just this section will give you a solid understanding of the Sin&shy;darin in _LotR_. You'll be able to pronounce the words, write in _tengwar_, and put together Sindarin phrases of your own.

The second section, **Branches**, is about the tough decisions that Tolkien made (or avoided) when working out the grammar of Sindarin —there are many parts of the language where he just couldn't make up his mind. Often, we know that he considered multiple options for a particular piece of the grammar, but it's not clear which one he settled on or if he even did settle on anything. In such cases, I think it's best to describe the alternatives and their ramifications.

The final section, **Scattered Leaves**, covers the various attempts that have been made to "complete" Sindarin. You'll need to read this section to understand the Sindarin dialogue in the _Lord of the Rings_ movies, since the language used there is largely a post-Tolkien invent&shy;ion.

## Online Resources

This book is designed to complement the existing online resources for learning Sindarin, not to replace them. That's why I haven't included a dictionary or a list of Sindarin texts—you can easily find these on the web. That being said, the online resources vary widely in quality, so I've posted a list of trusted links at **menegroth.github.io/links.html**

## Feedback

This book is a work in progress—the current version is in fact an alpha release, intentionally left incomplete in the interest of getting feedback quickly.
