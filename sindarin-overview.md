# A Short History of Sindarin

# From Goldogrin to Sindarin

# A Taste of Grey-Elven

Sindarin has a system of consonant mutations that affect many parts of the grammar. The idea behind consonant mutations is that the first sound of a word will change in certain conditions, sometimes to express a particular grammatical idea, sometimes simply to harmonize better with the sound of the previous word. Consonant mutations play a large role in the fictional historical development of Sindarin and are one of the main ingredients that give it richness and depth.

> [.s Cîr tollen ammen] "Ships have come for us"
> [.s ach ú-aníron gîr] "but I do not desire ships"
> [.s i ven i chîr hollen anim] "the path of the ships is closed to me"

You'll notice in the above example that "ships" can be rendered [.s cîr], [.s gîr], or [.s chîr].

This is just a short selection of the most common Sindarin words. A comprehensive dictionary would take a book of its own, but fortunately for me I don't have to write one, since there are several good Sindarin wordlists available online. You can find links to them at the URL below:

## Pronunciation

Pronounce the vowels as if they're Spanish or Italian. [.s Y] is pronounced as in _icy_ or like _ü_ in German _über_. Most of these words happen to be stressed on the first syllable, though that's not the general rule in Sindarin. You can find a more complete pronunciation guide <a class="pageref" href="#pronunciation"></a>.

## Verbs

N.B.: All of these verbs are given in their _imperative_ or "command" form—so they work for telling someone to do something, but not for describing what they did. For more verb forms, you'll have to read the upcoming chapters!
