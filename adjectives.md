Adjectives in Sindarin usually come after the noun they modify—the opposite of English word order.

!!example

[.s barad <span class="hi">dûr</span>] "<span class="hi">dark</span> tower"

[.s ered <span class="hi">luin</span>] "<span class="hi">blue</span> mountains"

## Soft Mutation of Adjectives

Adjectives often undergo soft mutation of their first consonant when following
a noun.

In many cases, the adjective isn't mutated. This can happen in a few
different situations:

- The adjective is being emphasized, perhaps to show a contrast. ("no, no, the _blue_ mountains!")

- Mutating the adjective would result in a sequence of consonants that's hard to pronounce.
  _Barad-Dûr_ sounds more natural than _Barad-Dhûr_.

- Mutation would create an ambiguity that couldn't be resolved by looking at the context. For instance,
  [.s i berian vell] could mean either "the strong hobbit" or "the dear hobbit", since [.s bell] "strong"
  and [.s mell] "dear" both become [.s vell] under soft mutation. Because of this, it might not always be obvious
  what [.s i berian vell] is supposed to mean, so you have the option of avoiding the mutation and saying
  [.s i berian mell] or [.s i berian bell] instead.

## Word Order

Sometimes adjectives can be placed before the noun. Often this is done to preserve the
meter or rhyme scheme of a poem. 

When an adjective comes before a noun that's also modified by the article [.s i], the adjective comes after the [.s i]. 
Because of this, the soft mutation from [.s i] affects the adjective instead of the noun.

!!example

"the green jewel" = [.s i vîr galen] / [.s i galen mîr]

/!

## Plural Adjectives

When a noun is plural, any adjectives that modify it must be pluralized as well. This may seem
strange to English speakers, but pluralizing adjectives is fairly common in real-world languages;
if you've studied a Romance language it will seem very familiar.

Sindarin adjectives are pluralized using the same vowel mutation that nouns are subject to.

When the singular and plural forms of a noun are the same, sometimes the adjective is the only
way to tell that the noun is plural at all!

!!example

[.s mîr galen] "a green jewel" &rarr; [.s mîr gelin] "green jewels"

/!

## Adjectives in Sentences

Now we know how to say "the blue sky" ([.s i venel luin]), but what if we're trying to say "the sky is blue?"

The word for "is" or "to be" in Sindarin is omitted from most types of sentences where it would be used in
English. That means we have to rely on word order to convey meaning instead.

To say "the sky is blue", the adjective gets moved to the beginning of the sentence: [.s luin i venel].

!!example

[.s Maer i aes hen] "This food is good"

/!

A subtler way to express the same thing is to move the adjective to the end of the sentence and not soft-mutate it.

!!example

[.s I aes maer] "The food is good"

[.s i aes vaer] "the good food"

/!

However, this might be a bit *too* subtle if the first consonant of the adjective wouldn't even be changed
by soft mutation!

!!example

[.s I venel fanui] "the cloud-white sky" / "The sky is cloudy"

/!

## Multiple Adjectives

When multiple adjectives modify a noun, they're separated by [.s ah] "and", which is
usually shortened to [.s a] before a consonant.

!!example

[.s cuil air ah alfirin] "a lonely and immortal life"

/!
