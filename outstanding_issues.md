- CE awatʰā should change to OS autʰa, according to Salo 240, but does not. RESOLVED - conjectured environment for Salo 4.3 was too strict. Expanded to change `awa` to `aw`. The reconstructed OS form is `awtʰa`, not `autʰa`, but other reflexes of CS `au` show `aw` at this stage. c.f. OS `kʰawda` < CE `kʰagdā` (haudh), Salo 4.25.

- How does CE `arātā` lead to both S `arth` and `arod`? Stress difference? Salo 240.

- How does BERÉK lose the first vowel before the CE stage?

- How did the vowel change in CE kaem -> OS kai? c.f. kaolō -> kaulo (caul), ndaer -> ndair (daer)

- Why was the first vowel of CE karáni not lost (Caran)? Why was the second vowel of kárani lost (Carn)? Similarly, why was the second vowel of koronē lost?
