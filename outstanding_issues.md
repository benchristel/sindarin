How does CE `arātā` lead to both S `arth` and `arod`? Stress difference? Salo 240.

How does BERÉK lose the first vowel before the CE stage?

Why was the first vowel of CE karáni not lost (Caran)? Salo explicitly states that the second vowel was stressed.

There may be a misplaced sound change (ja -> ji) on Salo 43. The examples given look like middle Sindarin and the OS examples in the lexicon don't show this change. C.f. the entry for Ivon on 353.

etkelē → ekkʰele ‣ ektʰele "source". ekkʰele is expected here, but OS has ektʰele instead. Could be that the first syllable is stressed, which causes the tk -> kt metathesis?

spanâjā → spʰanôia ‣ spʰanúia "cloudy".

etlednā → etlenda ‣ etlenna "exiled"

> CE awatʰā should change to OS autʰa, according to Salo 240, but does not. RESOLVED - conjectured environment for Salo 4.3 was too strict. Expanded to change `awa` to `aw`. The reconstructed OS form is `awtʰa`, not `autʰa`, but other reflexes of CS `au` show `aw` at this stage. c.f. OS `kʰawda` < CE `kʰagdā` (haudh), Salo 4.25.

> How did the vowel change in CE kaem -> OS kai? c.f. kaolō -> kaulo (caul), ndaer -> ndair (daer) RESOLVED: there seemed to be a missing sound change that would cause this. `e` and `o` are already raised when long, so it's not that much of a stretch to say they might raise in long syllables in general.

> Why was the second vowel of kárani lost (Carn)? Similarly, why was the second vowel of koronē lost? RESOLVED: expanded the environment for the pre-CE change that causes vowel deletion.
