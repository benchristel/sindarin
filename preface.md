# <a name="preface"><em>Mae govannen!</em></a>

This book is about Sindarin, an Elvish language invented by
J.R.R. Tolkien as part of his fictional world of
Middle-earth. Actually, to say that Sindarin comes
from Middle-earth is a bit backwards; Tolkien was inventing
Elvish languages long before he ever dreamed
up _hobbits_ or the Ring or any of the rest of it. It would
be closer to the truth to say that Middle-earth comes from
Sindarin, for the Elvish languages were the real inspiration
for all the rest of Tolkien's legendarium. As Tolkien
himself wrote in a letter to his publisher,

> The invention of languages is the foundation. The <q>stories</q> were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in <q>Elvish</q>.[.cite letters 221]

Language was Tolkien's first love, and he considered the
invention of language to be inseparable from his writing.
After all, what is a story without a language
that can tell it? And what is a language without a story to
tell?

And what is either one, without people who remember it?

> [.s A Elbereth! Gilthoniel!]
> [.s Mí epholar sí, derthiel]
> [.s Vi ndorath hin geledhui,]
> [.s Gilgalad gaeryn ennui.]

> _We still remember, we who dwell_
> _In these far lands beneath the trees_
> _Thy starlight on the western seas._

## Why study Sindarin?

The _Lord of the Rings_ is aglitter with Sindarin names and
phrases: _Caras Galadhon_, _Amon Amarth_, _Minas Tirith_,
_Galadriel_. You can appreciate these words for their sound
alone, but knowing a bit of Elvish will
reveal the incredible depth of the stories behind them,
depth that can only be vaguely glimpsed by those who aren't
yet acquainted with the language.

But perhaps a more immediately compelling reason is that
Sindarin is simply beautiful. Tolkien delighted in "the moment of
association between sound and sense" and his words
have the feel of having been polished by a master craftsman:
they *sound* like what they mean.
Tolkien describes the peculiar feeling of inventing the word
*lint* in childhood, with the meaning "quick", and how he
was struck by the way the sound seemed to fit the meaning.
(The word survives, slightly modified, in Sindarin: [.s lim].)
His keen sense of the music of words is evident
everywhere in Sindarin.

Learning Sindarin will also help you learn other languages.
Sindarin's grammar is inspired by European languages, so
if you're trying to learn a language like
Spanish, French, or German, Sindarin is a good stepping
stone. Even if you don't follow
up your Sindarin studies with a foreign language course,
you may find yourself delighting in the subtleties of your
native tongue—and wielding it with greater confidence.

Of course, you probably want to actually *use* Sindarin
for something. Sindarin phrases can certainly lend an
Elvish flavor to roleplaying campaigns or Tolkien fanfiction.
If you study very hard, you might even be able to
keep a journal in Sindarin (though the language
naturally lacks the vocabulary for modern inventions like
cars and phones). And of course, you can write poetry, and
enjoy the poetry of others, which you can find in abundance
on the Web.

## About this book

This textbook is designed as an introductory course in the
Sindarin language. The lessons progress gradually from
easy topics to more complex ones, but at the end of each
lesson you will have learned a small piece of the language
that you can immediately start using. There are fill-in-the-blank
exercises at the end of each lesson so you can test yourself
and practice using the language.

The course assumes
no previous experience with foreign languages, although
a little knowledge of English grammar won't hurt, and if
you *have* studied a foreign language, that's better still.
At a minimum, you should be acquainted with terms like [.term noun],
[.term verb], [.term first person], and [.term past tense],
or be ready to look them up!

The book is divided into four parts: an introduction, two groups of
lessons, and a reference section.

- The **Introduction** orients Sindarin within Tolkien's life
   and legendarium, covers the basics of Sindarin
   pronunciation, and introduces some useful phrases and
   vocabulary. Read this part first before moving on to
   the lessons.
- **Writing Systems** teaches the basics of the Elvish
   alphabet _tengwar_. You won't need this information
   for the Grammar lessons in the next section, so you can
   skip it if you wish.
- **Sindarin Grammar** describes the rules for putting
   words together into sentences. In this
   section, you'll learn to read, write, and speak the
   language.
- The **Reference** section compiles all the
  grammar rules introduced in the lessons, for when you've
  mastered the basics of the language but still need to look
  things up occasionally.

## One big asterisk

Now, before you run off and buy your ticket to Middle-earth,
I need to burst your bubble a tiny bit. The truth is...
you can't *really* learn to speak Elvish—at least not in
the way you might be imagining.

One problem with learning the Elvish languages is that
Tolkien never intended them to be used by anyone
other than the characters in his books, so he never
wrote any reader-friendly dictionaries or grammar lessons.
He also changed his mind repeatedly about various
details of his languages, and his notes often contradict
each other.
This makes it very difficult to know
whether our Sindarin compositions
resemble anything Tolkien himself might have
written.

Because of this inherent uncertainty, speaking Sindarin
is a bit like
drawing a dinosaur. We might never know for sure what
color T-Rex was, but if you're going to draw one, you have to
make it *some* color—so you just choose one that seems
plausible and make a mental note that you might be wrong.

Similarly, we can never really know what Tolkien had in
mind when creating his languages, so when it's not clear
how to translate something the normal course of action is
to just choose a plausible option and forge ahead.
Unfortunately, while
some translations are likelier than others, not everyone
agrees on the *same* translation. That means
that even if you memorize this book cover to cover, you
might find it hard to communicate with other people in
Sindarin, especially if they learned from a different
source.

There is no need to despair, however. In time you may come to
see the limitations of Sindarin as a strength rather
than a weakness. When something is hard to phrase in
Sindarin it's sometimes because it simply doesn't fit into
Tolkien's world, but if you learn to cut away the indirection
of modern speech you can often phrase your meaning in a
surprisingly Elvish way. You could reword a sentence like
"My computer's been acting strange recently" to
"My writing-<em>palantír</em> may be dying. I am afraid."
[.s I balannir-e-deithad nîn ce fíriel. Thoss tôl anim.]
Sindarin forces you to simplify your words and say what you
really mean—a valuable skill no matter what language
you write in.

Despite these constraints, the aim of this
book remains ambitious. I have tried to present a "complete"
and faithful rendition of Sindarin—always keeping in mind,
of course, that such a "completed" language should not
be treated as authoritative or set in stone. Indeed, I have
left some parts of the book deliberately vague, because I feel
that a precise and formal description of Sindarin would
go against the spirit of the language. When considering
details like word order, or whether a certain sound-shift
should apply, the ear and heart are a better guide than
any rule.

Therefore, do not worry too much about any
uncertainties you encounter as you read through this book.
Though it might be impossible
to make Sindarin your second language, it can be much more than that.
Just keep coming back; revisit
it as you would an old friend, and soon you will come
to know its habits as your own.
Sindarin can be a home away from home, another mode of
thinking and being: dwell in it, and it
will grow around you like a forest.

## Reconstructed Words

When we can't find the words to translate something into
 Sindarin, often
our only option is to *reconstruct* a word based
on one of Tolkien's other languages.

Tolkien's Elvish tongues, which include Sindarin and Quenya,
are all related in a family tree. At the beginning of
Middle-earth's history all the Elves spoke one language:
Primitive Quendian. As different groups of Elves spread
across the land and formed isolated bands, their languages
gradually changed and drifted apart from one another.
Sindarin and Quenya are two such languages—they are siblings
in the family tree, with Primitive Quendian as their parent.

In both Sindarin and Quenya, the way that words and sounds
changed over the years followed regular patterns. This means
that for any Primitive Quendian word, we can apply some
sound change rules and peer into the word's future, working
out what it would later become in Sindarin or Quenya. The
same process works in reverse—by applying sound change
rules backwards, we can find the Primitive Quendian ancestor
of a Sindarin or Quenya word.

Reconstructing a Sindarin
word usually involves tracing a Quenya word back through
history to find its Primitive Quendian ancestor, and then
walking the sound changes forward to find out what the
word would have become in Sindarin.

For example, let's imagine that we didn't know the
Sindarin word for "beautiful" and wanted to reconstruct it.
In Quenya, "beautiful" is _vanya_. We can trace this back
to Primitive Quendian and discover that the ancient form
of the word is _banjā_. From there, we just have to follow
the Sindarin sound changes to figure out that Sindarin for
"beautiful" is [.s bain].

That is how reconstruction works in the best case, but often
it's more complicated. We don't always know if Tolkien
intended for a Primitive Quendian word to survive in
Sindarin—maybe he imagined that the Sindarin-speaking Elves
replaced it with a different word. Sometimes reconstruction
produces a form that's identical to an existing
Sindarin word, so we can't use it without creating ambiguity.
Sometimes it's not clear exactly how the
sounds should change. Even when it is clear, we're
left wondering if Tolkien himself would have used the
word, or if he would have thrown it out and invented a
different one.

Reconstruction is therefore always a stab in the dark: a
last-resort means of doing a translation when there is
simply no better option.

It is good to be aware of which words are reconstructed
and which are Tolkien's, because not everyone
will understand or approve of a given reconstructed word. I've
followed the convention of other writers and marked
reconstructed words with an asterisk (\*).

## Movie Sindarin

When the _Lord of the Rings_ films came out, it seemed like
*everyone* was learning Elvish. Many courses and websites
were written to teach the languages spoken in the movies.

In the years that followed, more of Tolkien's unpublished
notes came to light, and some of them proved that a lot of
words and grammar used in the movies were inaccurate. For
instance, movie phrases such as [.s le hannon] ("thank you") and [.s hennaid]
("thanks"), are now widely regarded as incorrect (or at least
unsupported by evidence from Tolkien's own writings).
Nevertheless, you can still find Tolkien fans on the Web using
[.s le hannon] to mean "thank you", because there is simply
no better alternative.

The upshot of all of this is that learning proper Tolkien-Sindarin
is not sufficient to understand the dialogue in the _Lord of the Rings_
movies, much less the living Sindarin language spoken on the Web.
And these versions of the language cannot be dismissed lightly; I
expect my readers will be nearly as interested in them as in
Tolkien-canon.

For that reason, I've included the movies' idiosyncratic words
in this book and marked them with a dagger (&dagger;).

## Typographical Conventions

As mentioned earlier, an asterisk (\*) before a Sindarin
word means the word is reconstructed. A dagger (&dagger;)
marks dubious reconstructions used in the _Lord of the
Rings_ movies.

All Sindarin text is in [.s bold italics]. Words
from other Elvish languages (mostly Quenya) are simply
_italicized_.

I have tried to keep the technical jargon in this textbook
to a minimum, but sometimes I have to use a linguistics term
for the sake of precision. The first use of a term is in
[.term small capitals]. If you aren't familiar with a term,
do a web search for it; you'll find many grammar sites that
are aimed at beginners and use comprehensible language.
