# <a name="preface"><em>Mae govannen!</em></a>

This book is about Sindarin, an Elvish language invented by
J.R.R. Tolkien as part of his fictional world of
Middle-earth. Actually, to say that Sindarin comes
from Middle-earth is a bit backwards; Tolkien was inventing
Elvish languages long before he ever dreamed
up _hobbits_ or the Ring or any of the rest of it. It would
be closer to the truth to say that Middle-earth comes from
Sindarin, for the Elvish languages were the real inspiration
for all the rest of Tolkien's legendarium. As Tolkien
himself wrote in a letter to his publisher,

> The invention of languages is the foundation. The <q>stories</q> were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in <q>Elvish</q>.[.cite letters 221]

Language was Tolkien's first love, and he considered the
invention of language to be inseparable from his writing.
After all, what is a story without a language
that can tell it? And what is a language without a story to
tell?

And what is either one, without people who remember it?

> [.s Mí epholar sí, derthiel]
> [.s Vi ndor haer hen galadhui,]
> [.s Gilgalad gaear annui.]

> _We still remember, we who dwell_
> _In these far lands beneath the trees_
> _Thy starlight on the western seas._

## Why study Sindarin?

The _Lord of the Rings_ is aglitter with Sindarin names and
phrases: _Caras Galadhon_, _Amon Amarth_, _Minas Tirith_,
_Galadriel_. You can appreciate these words for their sound
alone, but knowing a bit of Elvish will
reveal the incredible depth of the stories behind them,
depth that can only be vaguely glimpsed by those who aren't
yet acquainted with the language.

But perhaps a more immediately compelling reason is that
Sindarin is simply beautiful. Tolkien delighted in "the moment of
association between sound and sense" and his words
have the feel of having been polished by a master craftsman:
they *sound* like what they mean.
Tolkien describes the peculiar feeling of inventing the word
*lint* in childhood, with the meaning "quick", and how he
was struck by the way the sound seemed to fit the meaning.
(The word survives, slightly modified, in Sindarin: [.s lim].)
His keen sense of the music of words is evident
everywhere in Sindarin.

Learning Sindarin might even help you learn other languages.
The hardest
part of learning any foreign language is putting aside the
habits of your native tongue, and Sindarin provides ample
opportunity to unlearn English. Indeed, if you study Elvish
enough, English may seem the more peculiar language.

And of course, you probably want to actually *use* the
language for something. You can certainly use Sindarin to give an
Elvish flavor to roleplaying campaigns or Tolkien fanfiction.
If you study very hard, you might even be able to use it
for journaling or secret communication (though Sindarin
naturally lacks the vocabulary for modern inventions like
cars and phones). And of course, you can write poetry, and
enjoy the poetry of others, which you can find in abundance
on the Web.

## About this book

This textbook is designed as an introductory course in the
Sindarin language. The lessons progress gradually from
easy topics to more complex ones, but at the end of each
lesson you will have learned a small piece of the language
that you can immediately start using. There are fill-in-the-blank
exercises at the end of each lesson so you can test yourself
and practice using the language.

The book is divided into four parts: an introduction, two groups of
lessons, and a reference section.

- The **Introduction** orients Sindarin within Tolkien's life
   and legendarium, covers the basics of Sindarin
   pronunciation, and introduces some useful phrases and
   vocabulary. Please read this part first before moving on to
   the other two sections.
- **Writing Systems** teaches the basics of the Elvish
   alphabet _tengwar_. You won't need this information
   for the Grammar lessons in the next section, so you can
   skip it if you wish.
- **Sindarin Grammar** describes the rules for putting
   words together into sentences. In this
   section, you'll learn to read, write, and speak the
   language.
- The **Reference** section compiles all the
  grammar rules introduced in the lessons, for when you've
  mastered the basics of the language but still need to look
  things up occasionally.

## One big asterisk

Now, before you run off and buy your ticket to Middle-earth,
I need to burst your bubble a tiny bit. The truth is...
you can't *really* learn to speak Elvish—at least not in
the way you might be imagining.

One problem with learning the Elvish languages is that
Tolkien never intended them to be used by anyone
other than the characters in his books. He had the
inconvenient habit of never *finishing* a language.
For him, the joy of language creation was in constantly
tinkering and reworking things.
As a result, the descriptions of Sindarin in his notes are
full of beautiful words but contain very little information
about how we might put those words together into sentences.

Because of this uncertainty, speaking or teaching Sindarin
is a bit like
drawing a dinosaur. We might never know for sure what
color T-Rex was, but if you're going to draw one, you have to
make it *some* color—so you just choose one that seems
plausible and make a mental note that you might be wrong.

Similarly, we can never really know what Tolkien had in
mind when creating his languages, so when it's not clear
how to translate something the normal course of action is
to just choose a plausible option and forge ahead.
Unfortunately, while
some translations are likelier than others, not everyone
agrees on the *same* translation. That means
that even if you memorize this book cover to cover, you
might find it hard to communicate with other people in
Sindarin, especially if they learned from a different
source.

Another caveat with Sindarin is that some things are
just not worth translating; it feels like pounding
a round peg into a square hole. Any sentence that talks
about modern things like _phones_ or _driving_ or _college_
is going to come out sounding ugly and clunky in Sindarin,
because you'll have to build new compound words for each of those
things (and keep in mind—they won't be the *same* words that
other people would have used, so you
still might not be understood).

There is no need to despair, however. In time you may come to
see the limitations of Sindarin as a strength rather
than a weakness. When something is hard to phrase in
Sindarin it's sometimes because it simply doesn't fit into
Tolkien's world, but if you learn to cut away the indirection
of modern speech you can often phrase your meaning in a
surprisingly Elvish way. You could reword a sentence like
"My computer's been acting strange recently" to
"My writing-<em>palantír</em> may be dying. I am afraid."
[.s I balannir-e-deithad nîn ce fíriel. Thoss tôl anim.]
Sindarin forces you to simplify your words and say what you
really mean—a valuable skill no matter what language
you write in.

Despite these constraints, the aim of this
book remains ambitious. I have tried to present a "complete"
and faithful rendition of Sindarin—always keeping in mind,
of course, that such a "completed" language should not
be treated as authoritative or set in stone. Sindarin is
like a communal garden—always growing, always changing:
a patchwork of different people's translations that
sometimes harmonize and sometimes compete. By learning the
language, you too can become a gardener, and decide how you
want to translate your own thoughts into Sindarin. It is up
to you to decide what this language will become.

## Reconstructed Words

When we can't find the words to translate something into
 Sindarin, often
our only option is to *reconstruct* a word based
on one of Tolkien's other languages.

Tolkien's Elvish tongues, which include Sindarin and Quenya,
are all related in a family tree. At the beginning of
Middle-earth's history all the Elves spoke one language:
Primitive Quendian. As different groups of Elves spread
across the land and formed isolated bands, their languages
gradually changed and drifted apart from one another.
Sindarin and Quenya are two such languages—they are siblings
in the family tree, with Primitive Quendian as their parent.

In both Sindarin and Quenya, the way that words and sounds
changed over the years followed regular patterns. This means
that for any Primitive Quendian word, we can apply some
sound change rules and peer into the word's future, working
out what it would later become in Sindarin or Quenya. The
same process works in reverse—by applying sound change
rules backwards, we can find the Primitive Quendian ancestor
of a Sindarin or Quenya word.

Reconstructing a Sindarin
word usually involves tracing a Quenya word back through
history to find its Primitive Quendian ancestor, and then
walking the sound changes forward to find out what the
word would have become in Sindarin.

For example, let's imagine that we didn't know the
Sindarin word for "beautiful" and wanted to reconstruct it.
In Quenya, "beautiful" is _vanya_. We can trace this back
to Primitive Quendian and discover that the ancient form
of the word is _banjā_. From there, we just have to follow
the Sindarin sound changes to figure out that Sindarin for
"beautiful" is [.s bain].

That is how reconstruction works in the best case, but often
it's more complicated. We don't always know if Tolkien
intended for a Primitive Quendian word to survive in
Sindarin—maybe he imagined that the Sindarin-speaking Elves
replaced it with a different word. Sometimes reconstruction
produces a form that's identical to an existing
Sindarin word, so we can't use it without creating ambiguity.
Sometimes it's not clear exactly how the
sounds should change. Even when it is clear, we're
left wondering if Tolkien himself would have used the
word, or if he would have thrown it out and invented a
different one.

Reconstruction is therefore always a stab in the dark: a
last-resort means of doing a translation when there is
simply no better option.

It is good to be aware of which words are reconstructed
and which are Tolkien's, because not everyone
will understand or approve of a given reconstructed word. I've
followed the convention of other writers and marked
reconstructed words with an asterisk (\*).

## Movie Sindarin

When the _Lord of the Rings_ films came out, it seemed like
*everyone* was learning Elvish. Many courses and websites
were written to teach the languages spoken in the movies.

In the years that followed, more of Tolkien's unpublished
notes came to light, and some of them proved that a lot of
words and grammar used in the movies were inaccurate. Many
of the websites that used movie-style Sindarin were updated,
but the movies themselves, of course, were not.

This means that if you learn only "correct" Sindarin, much
of what's said in the
_Lord of the Rings_
movies will sound strange or just be unintelligible. For
this reason, I've included the movies' mistaken words
in this book and marked them with a dagger (&dagger;).
I don't *officially* recommend using them yourself, but at
least this way you'll be able to understand what Aragorn
and Legolas are saying.

I have another, more personal reason for including
movie-Sindarin in this book. The very first Sindarin
sentence I remember reading was written not by Tolkien, but
by David Salo, who did the Elvish (and Dwarvish and Orcish)
translations for the films. Movie-Sindarin was my
introduction to the language, and without Salo's work I
might never have started learning Elvish at all. I
therefore feel indebted to Salo, and want to make
sure that his work on the language, as well as Tolkien's,
is properly appreciated.

## Typographical Conventions

As mentioned earlier, an asterisk (\*) before a Sindarin
word means the word is reconstructed. A dagger (&dagger;)
means it is from the _Lord of the Rings_ movies.

All Sindarin text is in [.s bold italics]. Words
from other Elvish languages (mostly Quenya) are simply
_italicized_.

I have tried to keep the technical jargon in this textbook
to a minimum, but sometimes I have to use a linguistics term
for the sake of precision. The first use of a term is in
[.term small capitals]. If you aren't familiar with a term,
do a web search for it; you'll find many grammar sites that
are aimed at beginners and use comprehensible language.
