>   Thank you very much for your kind and encouraging letter. Having set myself a task, the arrogance of which I fully recognized and trembled at: being precisely to restore to the English an epic tradition and present them with a mythology of their own: it is a wonderful thing to be told that I have succeeded, at least with those who have still the undarkened heart and mind.

> The use of the circumflex in other [non-Sindarin] languages such as Adûnaic or Dwarvish has no special significance, and is used merely to mark these out as alien tongues (as with the use of _k_). <cite>(_The Return of the King_, Appendix E)</cite>

Perhaps Khuzdul and Adûnaic are "alien" to Middle-earth in the primary-world sense that Tolkien placed these languages in his stories after the world was first conceived. They were not the languages that sparked its genesis.
